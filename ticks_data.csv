The lower half felt like a classic alpine adventure, weaving between discontinuous cracks, well spaced gear, flowy... yummy.I'd have a hard time taking 5.9 for this climb in the same way I'd have a hard time taking 5.10a for Pinched Rib. It's a 5.7 to a V0 boulder - but hey, that also makes it a great way to dip a toe into the 5.9 matrix and prepare for the sustained sandbaggery heading your way on other Josh 5.9's.

I would highly recommend doing the same if your follower is not as comfortable as you are with downclimbing/scrambling down. The descent from T&G is not ‘hard’ per se, but it is fifth class for a time and would have certainly been very intimidating for my partner. There is somewhat serious fall potential.It’s my humble opinion that such cases really aren’t justified anymore, especially at a crag where a moderate route is so popular. If the descent is serious relative to the expected crowd: why not have a single slung boulder with rap rings per crag, in a position that is neither visually intrusive nor convenient for top-roping the crag classics to allow safe descent for those who would otherwise potentially be at risk?

When on top of the route, walk to the right about 15/20 feet. You'll find a chimney to down climb. Chimney is about 10 ft or so tall and at the bottom is gravel/sand. Once down, make your way right, and then you'll cutback to the left. Then you're in the gully. If you know this is the way down, it'd take only a few minutes to descend."", 'Really enjoyable route. It can be secretly pumpy up top, as I was having a hard time finding a good rest after the crux, before pulling the vertical easier wall. The anchor, if built on top, can be tricky. I used a purple .5 cam as my bomber piece in the floor crack up high, extended it, and used a yellow 2/blue 3 lower in that crack, but the direction of pull for those is not right, so used solely as backup. I recommend just top belaying.To descend, go right and you will find this gap with about a 15 foot chimney. Downclimb this, which is easy but just respect it, as it is a large drop. Then scramble down through the boulder field towards echo rock formation. Eventually you will go through this tunnel area.If you brought 4 draws and an anchor, hop on the 5.8 inhaler on the way out.

The couple of moves through that section seemed 5.4 or 5.5. After that there is an awesome #3 Camalot. Let's be serious. It is a trad climb, not a sport climb. Runouts should be expected especially if it is over terrain that is several grades lower than the rating of the climb. If you don't feel comfortable pulling 5.Easy no more than a boulder's height off the ground you probably shouldn't be trying to lead a 7+ just yet.

Gain the huge flake and lieback your way to the top. The book calls this ""very airy"", and I would agree wholeheartedly. Expect some runouts b\w bolts. Finish with a traverse to the bolted anchors above Butterballs.",Few small cams or nuts and quickdraws.,"['Story of the FA by Peter Haan, copied from a supertopo thread:The Birth of Wheat ThinAfter a fairly big season, summer wearing on, Bridwell and I went up to the Meadows to climb with Robbins and Jeff Dozier for the day. RR had just arrived for a quick trip with Jeff and his idea for an outing with the four of us, was Rawl Drive on Lembert Dome Appropriately the only real pitch followed a line of widely spaced bolts up the handsome west face of Lembert, after negotiating a rib lower down after the first belay. With RR leading off over the horizon in fabulous blue skies, and Jeff then also disappearing, Bridwell and I, being the youngsters of the group and certainly the self-styled bad boys, were left alone briefly to hone our skills of abject ridicule. You see, by this point, August 1971, we both knew RR and Jeff were just grand old men and had had to give up their reins to us squirts who certainly would know how to finally kick the horse in the flanks.So toward this end, Bridwell performs, entirely for my benefit at our smidgeon of belay spot, and realize, very close at hand since he was tied to Jeff\x92s trailing line and anchored at our belay, a hilarious mocking of RR\x92s showboating style of face climbing. Lots of stepthroughs with uncanny hops, operated at a frequency far beyond what RR had performed but indicative of the wasteful and exhibitionistic quality they had had, say maybe ten stepthrough hops within 25 seconds, reminiscent of Irish clog dancing. He went on to add for me, several very \x93alert\x94 memorable and classic RR facial profiles requiring he also flare the hell out of his nostrils and do RR eyes, as if to signify that in the beautiful alpine scene below us he as RR had sensed the Larger Picture from our aerie. As he actually began to follow the pitch, he continued this comedic routine with other Stony Point maneuvers, with lots of complicated back stepping, and a pronounced butt-outward posture to technically diminish the effect of the rock\x92s angle and add the last possible bits of fun to our skit. We had seen it all, and now we were having fun. It was one of the funniest things I have ever witnessed Bridwell do. It was somewhat born of affection for Royal but it also was to call a spade a shovel, I have to think. Anyway our shenanigans ended, RR never knew and thus would never be hurt by it and there went a couple of hours in the Meadows.But Jim and I weren\x92t done. We salvaged what was left of our productive day and roared back down to the Cookie area 50 miles away leaving the old farts with their memories, rappelled the soon-to-be Wheat Thin, and checked out this phenomenal formation. We were roped on and over the edge within an hour and half of leaving the Meadows.Wheat Thin, on the Nabisco Wall, was not thought of as something a climber from Good Society would have bothered with. The silly thing is about 1\x94 thick mostly, a flake so thin that in its expanse has many actual weathered through-and-through holes in its face as it stands mostly detached about 100 ft high above the actual Cookie top. And when I had been over in this area climbing, I of course had seen it, as everyone else had, and it did not even occur to me that it was a possible climb. What it looked like was mere ugliness and non-being---Nonclimbing, really, which can fill many climbing areas, especially 35 years ago.But Bridwell, in his March to the Sea, had noticed it and had decided we were going to make this thing happen somehow, so that other climbers could not have it. Kind of how Richard Pryor says, \x93Women, they\x92re weird, they buy shoes so that other women can\x92t have them\x94. And so over we go, bolts and hangers at the ready, and place a few really ugly, hideously protruding 1/4\x94 compression units in the vertical cliff wall just to the left of this piece of granite paper shuddering on the wall, while taking out a few razor-edged flakes staked in the crack here and there. Bridwell did most of this as I hung out above him.I am looking at him, he is wonderfully garbed in his all-white full-sleeved shirt and pants, but he is not happy. He is hammering away at the drill, but way fast, and doesn\x92t seem to be enjoying anything anymore. We had been having such fun. The drill in those days was not carbide and would narrow out and bind quickly. The bolts are bottoming out too soon. I don\x92t know. With him it could be anything. But eventually he clues me in. And then I see some blood, it\x92s near his crotch, let\x92s me know his hemorrhoids are killing him. And he is in white.So in the spirit of our raucous day that had begun in the Meadows, I take a motherly tone with him hanging 50 feet below me, trying to soothe him, advising my daughter about how this kind of thing happens to young ladies around this age, that it would become a regular thing, and that he should not be afraid it is just the weeping of the disappointed uterus. And he enjoys this new riff, jugs up, and I finished the last messed up bolt and we are out of there. So in a matter of an afternoon, Wheat Thin became the first rap-bolted climb in the Valley, only because it was such a fragile wildly expanding structure, and ironically authored by extreme trad climbers.We instantly went back the next day I recall, and started to climb our monstrosity. Since it was Jim\x92s idea, as we stand on top of the Cookie, he leads off way to the right on a flake ledge to access the incipient crack that runs up to the actual defined left facing 1\x94-4\x94 thick lieback flake. He has hammered the sh#t out of a Long Dong trying to get it into the meager bottoming crack; there is nothing between him and I besides this and he tries to develop the moves above this A3-quality placement to reach our fancy flake.He hates it; the situation is unexpected because the day before we had just looked at the flake higher up and not how to get into it. After about 30 minutes he actually backs off, gives me the lead. I am sure he was not at par either with his hemorrhoids. My advantage of course was that I did not drive the one and only point of protection between us, so I did not understand how it probably would not have held a real fall. I beat it a little, didn\x92t love it but went ahead anyway. So bold and ignorant, I established these fairly hard 5.10c barn-door moves to the flake, thinking that they were gross, inconvenient, and just in the way of our special-assed flake rather than the actual beef of the whole route. Climbing onwards to the top of Butterballs for the belay, I encountered nothing as difficult as this technical start I had just done and had actually kind of gotten bored tippy-toeing around this dangerous thin feature for a hundred feet. Jim swarmed up the route, and we were off.It turned out during subsequent ascents years later, a couple serious falls took place at the beginning, and that although it was to become a unique airy three-star route, the thing was nobody\x92s little plaything.

That being said, I really think this would be 5.10- at Indian Creek so if you are getting on the Prow or South Face or something and you didn't bring triples just get on it yo"", ""One of the most splitter cracks I've ever climbed.  My gear was (in order, black diamond colors): green, green, red, red, yellow, yellow, blue, blue."", ""Absolutely classic! Skip the #4 and just place the last of 3x #3 as high as it goes and you'll cruise to the top."", 'Pumpy with an aid rack on! Made a great start to The Prow.', ""Don't let previous comments about wanting a #4, or triples in #3 scare you into not doing this climb if you only have a double rack. This thing only needs doubles from .75 to #3 Camelot size. Triples of any size are unnecessary. Also, I'm glad I didn't bring a number 4 since you are well protected by the last #3 placement, and the final move up top where you would place it is pretty trivial."", ""Pretty fun lil adventure route.

I'm a descent crack climber my gear was 0.4 and 0.5 both placed standing to protect the start, 2 0.75, 2 #2, 2 #3 and a #4 just to take any sting off the top. As others have said though its not really an OW just a lil pod with holds and what not around it."", ""Travis is on point that the off-fingers start is the biz on this pitch. If you free Jo Jo to start the Prow you really don't need a huge aid rack, since the 2nd half of the pitch is quite thin. The topo recommends cam hooking but I opted to place small nuts so I could clip pro above the halfway ledge for Jo Jo.Bonus tip: I think it may be wise to position your haul bag at the original start just around the corner to the right. When our bag reached the halfway ledge atop Jo Jo it flew across the gap. Guess I'll send Jo Jo when pigs fly .... OH WAIT .. (lol)""]","Nov 8, 2024  ·  Lead / Redpoint."

After the Flake a few bolts lead to a decent-sized penji left to easy free climbing or C1 to the belay ledge. The free climbing variation left is super fast tension-to-bolts-to-easy-french-free or 5.12d. The Window Pane Flake is the feature that will help you find the Lurking Fear line when looking from the Bridalveil Falls straightway, either before or after your climb. Pitch 4. 12a or C2. 130' Cams - 2ea Offset Cams 2ea Cams to #4 Camalot Hooks Camhooks Secure hooking or 5.10 past bolts leads to really fun thin cracks which take you right and then up, gradually widening to #4 right before the belay. This really cool pitch brings you into the Milky Wave Headwall and a continuous crack system you'll follow until pitch 7. If the first 3 pitches were challenging and you feel beaten down don't worry - it's splitter from here on out! Pitch 5. 12b or C1. 100' Cams - 2ea Offsets 2 ea to #3 Camalot, 1ea #4 Camalot Hooks - optional some folks use a hook near the belay but it's not necessary Camhooks or Nuts could be helpful if you have fewer small cams, or just need to do one move that you are missing a crucial size in. Wavy twin 5.11 finger cracks take you up a steep wall - very straightforward pitch. Save 1ea Offsets or small cams for right before the belay. Pitch 6. 12c or C2. 110' Cams - 2 ea Offsets 3 ea to #1 Camalot, 1ea #2 and #3 Camhooks and / or thin Nuts useful if you are shorter or don't have lots of small cams All time Milky Wave splitter crack leads up to a thinner section to an interesting bulge to the belay. Save 1ea Offsets for the last section. I like to link this pitch into the hook traverse at the beginning of pitch 7 and then just belay at the rapppel anchor midway through that pitch. If you do this linking you just clip the pitch 6 anchor and tension over and right - feels super secure and easy moving between the bolts and hooks as opposed to leading right off the belay with your partner staring at you. It's hard to explain why - but this linking makes it easier for the cleaner too - since they're already on the jugs when they get to pitch 6 anchor they just use the rings on the anchor to lower out and follow the bolt/hook traverse. Pitch 7. 13c or C1. 105' Cams - 2ea .4 or Yellow Totem to #4 Camalot 1ea #5 Camalot Hooks - Regular no Camhooks Fun hook traverse interspersed with many bolts leads to another splitter though wide and slightly awkward crack system. Pitch 8. 10d or C1.130' Cams - 2ea .5 Purple Totem or Camalot to #5 Camalot - Can be done with only #4s but if you have the #5s it will make it easier. The most incredible 10c splitter for folks with Goliath-sized hands. Epically challenging fist to wider crack for the rest of us, or cruiser C1 with your comfy shoes on ;) Save a #3 Camalot for right before the belay Pitch 9. 5.10 or C1. 110' Cams - 1ea Offset Cams 2ea to #3 Camalot, 1ea #4 and #5 for right before the belay Super fun lower-angled splitter crack / flake that makes you feel free like Tommy or Babsi, and the nice belay ledge / stance at the end is welcome after mostly hanging belays since the ledge atop pitch 3. The Pillar of No Despair! Pitch 10. 5.12 or C2. 110' Cams - 2ea Offset Cams 2-3 ea to #.75 Green Totem or Camalot 1ea #1 to #3 Camalot Camhooks and thin Nuts useful A really beautiful if at times flared or thin shallow corner leads up to a couple reachy moves to the belay. Save 1ea Offset Cams and small Cams for the end of the pitch. Pitch 11. 13a or C2+. 100' Cams - 2ea Offset Cams 2-3ea to .75 Green Totem or Camalot 1ea #1 to #3 Camalot Camhooks Grappling Hook - can be nice for going over the bulge but is not necessary A couple Camhooks or 5.12 off the belay lead to a bulge with a bolt. Wild but relatively secure cams and fixed pitons lead to three bolts and to a mostly finger-sized crack that leads to the belay. Pitch 12. 12c/d or C2 Wild. 95' Cams - 2ea Offset Cams 2ea to #1 Red Totem or Camalot Hooks Wild and fun traversing 5.12 or C2 pitch over and around, with fun easy hooks to bolts that lead to 5.10 free or easy hooks to another traverse to the belay stance - save the two smallest offset cams for right before the belay if you don't like doing easy free moves with rope drag. Pitch 13. 12b or C1. 140' Cams - 1ea Offset Cams 2-3 ea to #1 Red Totem or Camalot 1ea #2 and #3 Camalot The beginning of the lower-angled crack climbing that leads to the summit. A short thin crack that takes bomber offset cams leads to fun cruiser 5.8 with maybe a fragile flake or two to a bulge move to the most glorious 5.3 hand and finger crack to the belay stance. So fun! Pitch 14. 10d or C2. 130' Cams - 2-3ea to #1 Red Totem or Camalot 1ea #2 to #5 Camalot A super fun but slightly tricky pitch. Deal with a few challenges low on the pitch and you'll be rewarded with super fun 5.5 to 5.7 scrambling to the belay; if you're not mindful of rope-drag early the second half of this pitch could be a miserable struggle. Aid or mantel onto a shelf and walk left for twenty feet to a wide gully. It's best if you can just put a piece in the bottom of the gully and walk back and remove the piece you put at the beginning of the traverse - this will help with rope drag and will allow your cleaner to just walk across a lower ledge to start following the pitch. Back at the gully a couple 5.10 or awkward C2 moves on .5 Totems / Camalot gets you to better cracks and easy cruising. Look for a good spot to put your #5 Camalot above a ledge after the fun cracks that will keep your rope straight for the follower (not necessary if the follower is free climbing only if they are jugging) and will give you the confidence to quest left and around and back up to the spacious belay ledge and its 2 bolts. I like to fix the rope to a piece in a crack on the far right of the ledge because there are a lot of edges on the route - there is a bomber finger-sized crack there - i back the rope up to the two bolts of course. Pitch 15. 10c or C2. 140' Cams - All of your cams. Camhook might be useful in case you don't have the right size thin piece or if you cannot reach a higher, bigger placement - it's never harder than 10a/b at the thin spots. Awesome but challenging 5.10 or C2 pitch. Some slick rock for the free climbers and few random thin placements for the aid climbers keep things interesting. Def use all your long runners on this pitch, in the zigzag section. Save some fingers to #1 Camalot sizes for the last bit to the belay. Pitch 16. 10b or C1. 140' Cams - 2-3ea Black Totem or .2 Camalot to #3 Camalot Finally the difficult eases to downright pleasant mostly 5.7 with a touch of 5.10 or easy aid - well I did it once too early in the spring running with water and that sucked but usually it's great. A ton of easy 5.5+ free climbing even for the folks wearing approach shoes on this one. Pitch 17. 11a or C1. 90' Cams - 2ea .4 or Yellow Totem to #1 Red Totem or Camalot. 2ea #4 and #5 Camalots - can be done with one #5 if you are taller or if you like 11a ow ;) Short, splitter hands to five inch crack leads to a mantel and easy cruising with a short 5.6 face section before the palatial Thanksgiving Ledge. Fun, quick pitch. Don't miss the anchor on the face to the left of the ledge that allows you to fix your rope straight above the previous belay - don't belay off the bolts in front of the cave. Pitch 18. 10b or C1. 95' Cams - 2-3 ea to #3 Camalot 2ea #4 Camalot Super fun jug / crack/ boulder mantel start leads to splitter twin cracks which you eventually commit to the left one and head into a short strenuous gully. The gully protects well with cams to #4 and after just fifteen to twenty feet you exit left into an epic hand and finger crack to the belay. Def save 1ea cams .5 to #2 Camalot for this last section. Ends on a cool pillar directly above the belayer. Pitch 19. 5.3 Glory! 135' Cams - 1ea to #3 Camalot Fun, juggy featured face leads to a corner with more jugs and cracks, past a cute Limber Pine and eventually right to the chains. You Did It Woohooo!","Double set of nuts, including small nuts. Triple set of cams up to red Camalot and double set of cams to old #4.5 Camalot. A selection of basic hooks, cam hooks and rivet hangers. Can also bring few heads in case any are missing.","['Great route!  As of Aug 2010 there were no rivets without hangers, they were all bolts with hangers.  Also, didn\'t see any real need for the fixed heads anymore; it appeared that maybe bolts had been added nearby, but who knows, maybe not.  The one head we did use was at the beginning of pitch 3, but that one could probably could have been bypassed by top-stepping in the aiders.  Also, much of the ""hooking"" mentioned on supertopo is easily avoided with a little tension traversing.', 'If rapping the route I would suggest going from the P8 belay (at the top of the 4"" OW all the way to the P6 belay. This can be done with double 60m ropes with 5-10 feet left to spare.You will still have to swing a ways to the left but you can use all of the bolts on the P7 traverse to get you there. A touch of sideways aiding on rappel.This also avoids the semi crappy rappel anchor at P7 (The free climbing anchor below this is good).', 'Trip Report on our 2011 ascent.Trip reportadrianpollard.posterous.com…', 'FFA: Tommy Caldwell, Beth Rodden, 6/2000', ""The topo says something about an 80' swing around the arete to reach the bivy ledge from the top of pitch 10. While I suppose you could get to the bivy ledge from the top of 10 if you had to....it would be a real hassle. Just plan on climbing to the top of 11 and rapping straight down to the ledge."", 'Beautiful route through pitch 12 or so, afterwards it changes from exposed clean splitter face to rambling alpine gully feeling.  Even with a light bag, hauling becomes very taxing after 13.  Fixed heads indicated in supertopo are shiny bolts save one which you could hook or free climb past. 18 and 19 do not link with 60m rope (30-40 feet short) per supertopo (if aiming for bolted station at top of 19, gear belay was fine though).  Top out slabs were longer than expected and one of the fixed lines indicated in the Sloan topo was not present.  Definitely some 5th class above pitch 19.  Many pitches were 10-25 feet longer than indicated as well - never an issue but added to the overall big wall feeling for sure.  Great route and an excellent experience.Really nice medium volume spring just past the route base was running as of early May 2015.', 'As of October 2015, everything is bolted. You do NOT need any heads, rivet hangers, or hammer. We carried all the extra gear for nothing.Overall was amazing route, good introduction to El Cap.', ""Great route. Our first El Cap route and a good one to prepare for harder walls. I used a couple fixed heads, but it seemed like these spots could be passed by hooking or top stepping if necessary. I brought three #4 cams which made the OW on P8 feel really safe and comfy. The hooking on pitch 12 was by far the highlight of the route with a super reachy hook move. Awesome! The pitches above 13 were much less inspiring and the hauling wasn't great. Awesome route though and I highly recommend it."", 'First El Cap route, climbed this one casually in 4 days with no major issues.  Great climbing up to about the half way point, then wanders a bit, and lower angle wandering.  I must have been off route on P1 did about 4 hook moves in a row.  Next up Zodiac or TT.', 'Hey Alan, I am one of the climbers that fell several weeks back. My partner and I have had no luck contacting you at all. We would both be very grateful if you would respond to one of our messages and return our gear for us. Thanks Chris', 'Fantastic route. After 13 hauling is harder but not that bad. Lost world bivey is nice for one, but bring hammock and it’s nice for two. No beaks, but bring grappling hook and Cliffhanger. Offset and totem cams were super nice!', 'Amazing, amazing route. I like that the description balances explaining that while it is the easiest route on El Cap, which is true, it is still fairly complicated (the success rate as of 2019 is around 40%). If you are under 120 lbs / 55 Kg, and are not adept at mountaineering style ascents with talus and third and fourth class terrain (there are fixed ropes, but it is still very strenuous with a pack), this route might be more difficult than the Nose - the aiding is more difficult than the Nose, it is lower-angled so the bolts are very, very reachy so slower and difficult for shorter folks, and just getting all your stuff up to the route is pretty stout. That said, if you climb in backcountry trad areas regularly, can hike around decently with a heavy pack, then LF will be easier than the Nose and super fun.This route is definitely not popular to rappel, don\'t know where that info came from. (It is possible for light, in-a-day teams to rap, but most are so cooked at the end they find the 1.5 hr walk down way easier and faster). We should just say that this route is set up with rappel anchors (a dedicated rap route takes you from Thanksgiving Ledge, straight back down to the route, avoiding the upper, wandry climbing).The release of  the world\'s first inflatable portaledge / inflatable sleeping pad combo, will change the logistical challenges of Lurking Fear greatly. Basically, most teams need a portaledge only for their first night on the wall, and the extra work required to get the portaledge all the way up to the route, and haul it up the route, really wears folks out.Folks email me with questions about the bivy ledge mid route a fair bit, so thought I would answer here. The ledge at 9.5 is only good for one, but with an inflatable ledge would be palatial. Also, it is not possible to climb to the bivy ledge and then \'lower out\' back on to the route, and climb pitch 10; the best you can do with this scenario is leave your haulbag at the anchor at the ledge, both climbers rappel down to the Pillar of Despair, belay 9, then you climb pitch 10 like normal........except that the leader has to wait to haul. After the cleaner has cleaned pitch 10 they will just rappel down to the ledge anchor, attach the haul line to the haul bag, and release the haul bag. I\'ve included a pic to show you all this (look in the photo gallery for the pic titled \'overlay of mid route ledge\').Here are some more thoughts on \'getting to the ledge,\' etc.A couple factors are in play - one major one being that pitch 10 is one of the harder pitches on the route, so that slows things down considerable (then pitch 11 is the crux so def not good to plan on doing that before bivying, as you would be likely to run out of time).When I climbed the route the first time I used this strategy:1. I led pitch 10, hauled the bag up a little ways, but it was still a few meters below the elevation of the ledge.2. My partner cleaned the pitch, like normal, but instead of clipping into the anchor they just handed me the gear sling they had just cleaned, pulled their grigri tight, and then rapped down to the bag.3. They \'walked\' the bag over to the ledge, and anchored it there.4. They also anchored the lead line5. I rapped down the lead line to the ledge, leaving the hauler all set up6. In the morning, I jugged up first and started to haul (shows why it is important to pull up 4 - 5 meters of slack before fixing the lead line, so you have this as a tie in while you\'re hauling. When you jug back up in the morning, you just tie back into the rope, and you\'re all ready to start hauling safely).7. My partner released the haul bag8. My partner jugged the lead line also, lowering out off the anchor on the ledge (careful to not get twisted up with the bag / haul line).Now with the new inflatable portaledge it will not be so important to reach the ledge; Pillar of Despair might be fine if you get there in the dark and don\'t want to deal with all this stuff (likely ;). The coolest thing about the inflatable portaledges is they are also a 4"" sleeping pad. That\'s right baby, 4 inch base camp pad on the Big Stone!Here is the amazing xRex pic of the Southwest / West face.....see the climbers on pitch 6?gigapan.com/gigapans/14756Erik Sloan, owner, RockclimbYosemite.com Yosemitebigwall.com - email me at erik@yosemitebigwall.com', ""Does anyone recommend bringing two #5 cams on this, since BD doesn't make the 4.5 anymore? Or would a single #5 be enough?"", 'Pink Thunder - A single #5 is plenty', ""Went up to do the bottom pitches yesterday,  just to see how high we could get in a day. Windy. Numb hands, even in full sun. Shortly after sunrise,  we notice little beads of ice trickling down the wall. This soon turned into frequent flurries of ice marbles,  exacerbated by strong gusts (of which there were many). Shortly after finishing pitch 3, a particularly heavy flurry (think hailstorm, without clouds) had us staring upwards in awe, like a couple of mezmerized idiots. When a refrigerator sized chunk of ice flew by, within 50 ft of us, and detonated on the earth below,  we decided we'd seen enough, and promptly rapped. Upon reaching the base, we noticed MILLIONS of ice chunks scattered all along the base, from LF to Dihedral Wall. Many were as big as baseballs.

I'd maybe bring a 3rd in case you drop one (I did, but on P1, we found it).We went all the way up to Ned's at 9.5. That is a very long, difficult pitch to free - quite harder than 10a up high - probably 11-. Quite doable, but plan to yo-yo for #4s. The nice thing is that you can leave the bags at Ned's and go all the way up to top of 11, haul from there (skip the haul at 10 that's a hanging belay).A stiffy quickdraw makes a lot of the ladders go faster/easier. (Long QD with coat hanger wire taped to make it stiff.)The haul to P14 is annoying. The leader needs to make sure the haul line doesn't get wrapped up in the chimney or something. The pitch goes quite a bit to the left.The last two pitches link with a 70, but the haul requires force. We put both of us on the haul to get the bags up.

By the next morning, crows had unzipped it and stolen most of our food.

I'm not sure it would have gone, and we'd of had to back-aid the P7 hook traverse as part of our bail.- Many of the early stations are two bolts, closely spaced, which contributed to absolute anchor fusterclucks.

Off the anchor of pitch 12 there is a newly placed bolt where a small cam or inverted cam hook can be easily placed under the flake.

Climbing this in April, though our route was dry, the friction feet were still not 100% dry on the rock, making this section feel committing.  That said, I committed and had no problem getting through it traversing hands on the small crack and using friction feet on the face.  I later saw another climber put feet in the crack and use undercling hands in the same crack as well for this part, which looks like it might have felt easier (though probably would have made the pro more awkward).After the traverse on P1, if you\'ve got big hands you\'ll be treated to an all-too-short splitter crack, followed by the aforementioned tree belay (good idea).For P2, I found the roof move right above the tree to be easy with my big hand jams, but my 5\'2"" female partner with small hands had quite a bit more difficulty with it.

Towering nearly 3000' this route offers 31 pitches of superb climbing right up the middle of the wall. Often referred to as the ""best rock climb in the world"" it is obvious why this route is one of the most sought after big walls in the valley and the world. Most of the pitches on this route are outstanding but with classics such as the ""Stovelegs"", ""King Swing"" and ""Great Roof"" you'll wish it would never end. Although this is a great climb the route is still very demanding, sustained and exposed and not to be taken lightly. Here are a few tips that might improve a parties chances of success and enjoyment on the route. First if you and or your partner(s) can lead 5.10 solidly this will greatly speed up the amount of time it takes to climb this route as a large percentage of the climb is 5.10 or easier. Second study the topo carefully because there are numerous opportunities to either link or use alternate belays in order to skip pitches (a team of three can also skip hauling certain pitches with some good planning). Unavoidable factors are the number of parties on the route and the weather, both of which can make the route not so classic. For pitch by pitch info and topo's the ""Yosemite Big Walls Supertopo"" guide book is highly recommended.","Bring two sets of nuts with offsets, one or two sets of micro nuts with offsets and two or three sets of cams from .5"" to 3.5"".

Pure Free Climbing - 5.14a. People often point out that there are only seven pitches rated 5.12a or harder on the Nose (only 7 out of 30!), but that doesn't mean that the rest is easy. Heck the first four pitches all have short, slippery sections of hard 5.11 that regularly spit off 5.13 climbers. And sure it gets more splitter after the first four pitches, but the exposure (and the wind!) cranks up and most folks find even the Boot Flake, a mere 5.10c, too much to free climb. To free climb the Nose is badass!...and there is a reason why only a handful of people have done it. Stats: .0000001% of all Nose climbers2. French Free - 5.10 C1+. If you can free climb solid 5.10 multi-pitch in the Valley, like you can knock off East Butress of El Cap (awesome for getting the descent dialed, too ;), Serenity to Sons of Yesterday, Northeast Buttress of Higher Cathedral, Steck/Salathe, and maybe Freeblast, with little challenge, then climbing the Nose in three and a half days (half day fix to Sickle, first day to El Cap Tower, second day to Camp 5, third day to the top) in a french free style (free climbing half or more of most pitches and just pulling on pieces through the more difficult sections) should be easy enough. Stats: 10 - 15% of Nose climbers3. Traditional Bigwall Style - 5.8 C2. For most of us, despite talking a good game, the aiders come out about 15 - 20 feet up the first pitch. The Nose is incredible, but it is not easy. I have climbed the Nose over 20 times and there are 5.9 pitches that I have not freed completely. Everything is harder with two ropes and lots of gear on you! That said, the Nose is awesome at this grade, and it should be encouraging to all climbers that with good physical fitness, you only have to climb 5.8 to climb the Nose! Despite how much practice aiding you did at your home crag, and how many triathlons you just competed, climbing a warm up route - with the partner(s) you intend to climb the Nose with - like South Face of Washington Column, The Reg on Half Dome, SW Face of Liberty Cap, or West Face of the Leaning Tower shortly before your Nose climb will greatly tune you into the mountains and how you can thrive on them. The Nose in this style will take you four and half days to climb - a half (to three quarter) day fixing to Sickle, day one to Dolt Tower or nearby, day two to Camp 4, day three to Camp 6, Day four to the summit(maybe with time to walk down, but why rush - enjoy a night on top!)  A fair number of folks tell me they wish they had done the East Buttress(5.10c) of El Cap before climbing the Nose, so they would have had the descent dialed, and could relax more on top. Stats: 60 - 70% of Nose climbers4. NIAD (or NIADL - NIAD in daylight) - 5.10 C1+. Climbing 28 pitches in a day, with a casual 10 - 15 minute approach and a mellow 1 hr descent, is ridiculously good. But don't kid yourself that it is better than bivying on the route - it's awesome, but shorter lived ;). Onsighting the Niad is pretty rare. Most folks practice for the Niad by climbing the first third of the route, to Dolt Tower or Eagle Ledge, which allows you to understand how to get through the traversing lower bit efficiently. Then it's good to climb South Face of Column, SW FAce of LIberty Cap, or Reg on Half Dome, in a day to get ur systems more dialed.

The goal is to get the rap route from Dolt Tower set up for one 60m rope rapping in early spring 2017. It gets very windy on the Nose, and folks spend so much time on the lower part of the route dealing with second ropes that are blowing around, that these new rap stations should be super useful. There have also been numerous rescues due to stuck ropes. These new rap stations will alleviate some of the congestion from people slowing down to deal with a second rope, whether they are teams that are fixing to Sickle(have the second jug with the extra ropes in a pack!) or those that are doing a Dolt Run to practice, and will allow people to climb safer and more efficiently through the lower part of the route.If Fixing Ropes from Sickle:You no longer have to tie your ropes together and pass knots - you rap down 190' to the first anchor, another 190' to the second anchor, and then 197' to the ground. There are anchors in between these stations for one-rope rapping.Pros of Consof Fixing Ropes to Sickle as opposed to hauling right from the base of Pine Line ledge:Pros:1. You don't have to bring all of your stuff when you start, and can remember things you might need during your initial climbing (very, very huge - if you are not super experienced with bigwall climbing this alone is probably reason enough to fix to Sickle).2. You get to try out the climbing and exposure of El Cap without the commitment. Fix down from Sickle and take a hot shower and eat a pizza - you'll be twice as stoked!3. Allows you a day to see which other parties are starting the route, and how their progress is going, without being stuck behind them.Cons:1. Fixing to Sickle means having to bring a third rope, to rap down, so if your partner is not sturdy enough to jug with a pack with two ropes in it (you lead with one rope, other two ropes go in the pack with water, wind jackets, and snacks), then you are just making more work, more hauling, just to get the ropes fixed so you can haul some more (I'm saying that you will have to haul a small bag with two ropes to Sickle Ledge, just to rap down and haul your big bag from the ground to Sickle Ledge). This is a pretty big con, and I would recommend any teams that weigh less than 115 lbs to consider if it would just be easier for them to haul from the ground, and continue climbing. (of course, you can pretty easily meet up with another party that is also fixing to Sickle, and agree to share their third rope (You would fix your two ropes down from Sickle, but just use their third rope to reach the ground), and then you only have to climb with two ropes like normal and can have all of the benefits of fixing to Sickle above).2. You have to deal with the jockeying for position that is the reality that there are normally many parties trying to climb the Nose. When you haul right from the ground, you are on the wall, and you will quickly find a pace and rhythm of ascent that keeps you a pitch or two above or below other parties. It is common for people to share fixed lines from Sickle - so seeing one set of lines is no guarantee that you might jug up to Sickle after fixing and only find one party there. The last years have seen big traffic jams on the lower part of the route, around Sickle.In the future, having fixed ropes from Sickle, in season, that climbers maintain but can use anytime, might go along way toward mitigating the congestion around this part of the route.Woot!Erik SloanRockclimbyosemite.com - Yosemitebigwall.com"", ""There have been some changes to the Nose route/topo (Bigwall routes are always evolving) over the years. Reading the description at the top of this page I understand now why folks might still be using the outdated Supertopo topo, and not our more current one.1. The 11a variation to the left of the first pitch (believed to be the original first pitch of the Nose, as climbed by Harding), is now the first pitch of a new, bottom-to-top free route (5.13d, 38 pitches), and is well bolted (as is a second pitch(5.9, five bolts) to the popular Pine Line which is right below this first pitch. There is a new anchor 10'/3m down and left of the 1st pitch anchor on the Nose for this variation pitch. This could provide a convenient way for Niad or other parties to pass people on the first pitch.2. New anchor 15' above Sickle Ledge. The pitch off Sickle Ledge, 210'/62m, has always been tricky for bigwall parties (meaning those hauling bags) because folks tend to bring a 60m haul line, which comes up short right as the leader is trying to do the last moves (steep 5.9+), to the belay. This new anchor allows you to haul your haulbag to a slightly higher anchor (best if you just do it when you are hauling to Sickle - so don't haul to Sickle and then do another 15'/5m haul, just climb up to the higher anchor (3rd class) and haul to there instead). Now the pitch off of Sickle is a manageable 190', and folks are having less epics there.3. Bolted anchor at the base, and end, of the Lynn Hill Traverse pitch. Two pitches before Camp 4, in the notoriously loose 'Grey Bands,' is the Lynn Hill Traverse pitch. The belay used to be one bolt and small cams but is now two bolts. Climbers scoped and developed this variation to the original Nose route because of the ubiquitous loose rock in the entire, four pitch Grey Bands section. This is a much better way to climb toward Camp 4, and these newly bolted anchors allow more options for parties, who tend to get congested in this area. Before, folks who climbed this variation had to climb the wrong way up and right, 15'/3m, to a bolted anchor at the end of the pitch. Now there is a two bolt anchor right at the end of the Traverse, which also makes the super traversing next pitch to Camp 4 a little more straightforward.4. Old Belay re-established belay Great Roof. For a while in the 90s and 2000s the belay for the GR was a bolt and two fixed pins at a horn right below the corner that leads to the roof. The bolt is still there, and can be used by Niad parties looking to pass, but the old belay 10'/3m below this spot, which is a nice stance ledge and is the original belay, has been re-established with three good bolts.5. Belay below the final bolt ladder reduced in size, new bolts added for belaying higher, towards the end of the bolt ladder. While the Free Nose climbers still build a belay at the top of the final 10c crack off the Wild Stance (because the free route through the bolt ladder is wandering and stout), there is no longer a spread out belay there but instead there is one 50' higher up the bolt ladder. This helps the top-out pitches flow much smoother as now you do a longer, 135'/42m pitch off the Wild Stance, and then a short pitch to the anchor below the summit, instead of a short pitch off the Wild Stance (awesome hang), and then a long pitch over the bolts and around the slab (which is always windy and difficult to communicate through).Woot!ErikYosemitebigwall.com - RockclimbYosemite.com"", 'Lowering Out is probably the most important new skill, after jugging, that climbers need to learn for the Nose.

Is there a safe way for the second to repeat the swing rather than doing a lower out? My thought is this.

He leaves a sacrificial QuickDraw and lowers back down and does the swing like the leader. Any safety concerns? Is the draw necessary or would feeding the rings be okay?

The main issue I foresee with your system is that the rope running from the leader up to the anchor might be in the way of the second during the swing.  Also when you make the swing you enter the corner above Eagle Ledge, so you might have to lower down to the ledge with a directional?  An alternative solution (my preferred method) which is faster and also skips hauling one and a half pitches, is to make the King Swing and then then back clean all of your gear up to the pitch 17 belay.  Then continue leading up pitch 18 back cleaning the lower portion of the pitch to avoid rope drag and make the pendulum to the intermediate belay on pitch 19.  Haul the pig from here and your follower just needs to lower out (or swing) from the top of the Boot Flake.  Additionally you can skip another one and a half pitches of hauling by leaving the pig at the intermediate belay on pitch 19 (make sure the pig is hanging from the anchor with a fifi held upright with a prusik) and climbing up to the pitch 20 anchor.  Your follower will then clean pitch 20 and you continue up pitch 21 and haul the pig from the top of pitch 21, avoiding all the trouble of hauling the rest of pitch 19 & 20.

First I believe that dialing in your transitions and rope management may be the single biggest thing that could help save you time. We passed/watched quite a few parties that were building weird anchors and always doing things differently etc. the nose has bolted anchors from top to bottom and all you need to do is pre tie two quad style anchors and then when you get to the anchor you just clip it in and do what you need to do.  Recognize how to keep your haul line and lead line from tangling, and learn how to do the revolving door technique with a carabiner to move ropes in and out of each other. Practice hauling on other routes beforehand. Saw a lot of weird hauling up there that didn’t look fun. Do some shorter walls that are technically harder than the Nose. I found The Prow to be really good because it’s sustained aiding at a level that is more difficult than anything on the nose. Also hauling the last couple pitches is more difficult than any hauling on the nose.  Dial in your lower outs and techniques for following traversing terrain. The nose has gobs of traverses on it and you can waste a lot of time in that terrain if you don’t know what you’re doing.  I find when following easier low angle traverses over towers and stuff it’s sometimes easiest to just throw the gri gri on and self belay while French freeing.  Also free climb as much as possible. We didn’t free that much, but a mix of French free/free/aid goes a long way to efficiency. If you think you’ll be aiding the 5.8 glory hand crack on the stovelegs, you may want to reconsider your route choice.I’m no expert, but these are my reflections on the trip and I feel may be more helpful than “you need a set of offsets for the nose” because though that may be true, if you’ve never placed an offset before going up on the nose, just having it isn’t go to do much for you.', 'Dom, Can you elaborate on ""the revolving door technique with a carabiner to move ropes in and out of each other..""

Most of the free is hard 5.10 with a few exceptions, and you need to be a 5.10 leader to be able to deal with anything that may come up. The Nose has been climbed so quickly and by so many people that it tends to get minimized, but it is a long serious route, and giving it a light rating may seem cool to some people, but it is a disservice as far as general info. If you aid every possible pitch then the hardest mandatory free climbing would be 5.9, but if you aid every possible pitch it will take you a week to top out. Be prepared for many crack pitches in the 5.10C-D range. Even if you do aid every pitch, the swing into the stoveleg crack is absolutely a 5.10 manuver. It is also harder than A2.The swing is huge and you have to hurdle a flake in mid swing. When you dive into the hand jams of stoveleg and get your feet in the crack you are on a massive runout. Any pendulum is A2 just because its a pendulum. The stoveleg pendulum is giant and has obstacles. A2+ minimum. When i led the great roof there was a pin missing under the roof right in the middle.

A continuously steep and strenuous route with some of the best exposure around. The route is technically easy, but can be mentally wearing due to the nature of the climbing. From the very start there is instant exposure. An awesome wall to cut your teeth on. Every pitch can be linked with a 60m rope and the hauling is really easy since the bag is almost always free hanging. Link pitches 1-2, 3-4, 5-6 for sure and it's much quicker. These take very little actual gear. The route goes completely clean unless any fixed heads blow. P1: C1F 120' - STEEP! Follow the bolt ladder straight up to a short C1F bulge that requires some small gear (cams, nuts, cam hooks, to 1""). Continue up the bolt ladder to a hanging belay. P2: C1 80' - STEEP! Continue up the bolt ladder with a few 0.4-1"" placements to an OK/poor stance belay. P3: C2F 5.7 80' - Follow the crack past a few random bolts to a great small ledge belay. Mandatory free move to get onto the ledge itself or a hook move or two. Not to bad, just awkward. P4: C1 5.6 80' - Continue following the crack up off the right side of the ledge and finish up on a bolt ladder that curves left to a mandatory 5.6 free finish onto Guano Ledge. If bivying on Ahwahnee Ledge, move over there and haul from those anchors. If continuing straight up, haul from Guano Ledge. Ahwahnee is a great ledge that slopes into the wall slightly with several good bolts along it for fixing a line. PLUSH P5: C2 100' - From the Guano Ledge anchor make a free move up to clip a high pendulum bolt. Swing right around a corner to aid up a C2 crack. Follow that up to a right leaning small ramp that joins a vertical C1 crack. Follow that straight up to the belay. Don't haul here! P6: 5.7 C1 - Mandatory 5.7 moves off the belay for 20-30' no pro. Not hard, but can be scary in aid boots. Can't bypass with cheat stick unless you've got an extended ""Lovetron"" (ha!). Follow the bolts as they curve left to a hanging belay. No cams needed on this pitch. Do a single haul from Ahwahnee or Guano Ledge. P7: 5.10 or C1 140' - Longest pitch on the route. Straight up the crack off the belay. Gotta back clean a lot or you'll never make it. Only 1 bolt on the pitch and it's sorta shady. Finish on the slab at a poor stance belay. P8: C1 50' - Follow the crack up to the slab to the roof and follow up to the nice anchor. Easy and short P9: C1+F 90' - STEEP and strenuous. IMHO the best / most fun pitch of the wall. Follow the fixed gear straight up a crack and up the roof. Finish on some mandatory 5.6 after clipping some semi hidden pins to get into easy terrain. Finishes on long sloping poor bivy ledge. P10: C2 80' - Break out the 4.5"" (#4 and/or 5 camalot) and be ready to backclean it. This pitch takes all size gear from micro to huge. Finish on a horizontal roof traverse and keep your rope extended so it doesn't wedge in the roof for your second. Finishes on an awesome bivy ledge for 3+. Fix the rope well for your second. The good anchor is 30' from the roof, but there are some intermediate bolts and pins to clip so no one takes the big pendulum ride. P11: 4th class 40' - Easy scramble up and right to the top. Wonder around and find the rap slings off the back after any Hero Shots have been snapped. Other info: The bolt ladders are NOT reachy (Harding was a short dude) It is 430' from the start of the route at the dead tree to the ground (the Supertopo is incorrect and undershoots it by 30'). You'll need a minimum of a 60m + 70m rope and that will just barely make it (so I'm told) Many cracks are filled with birds and nests (swifts?), hence the guano on Guano ledge. If you hang out on Guano Ledge, you WILL be pooped on. The birds are in their cracks at night, dawn, & dusk, which adds a degree of excitement while climbing past them. They mostly just squawk at you though. Don't smack them around! The route is mostly sheltered from storms, except Ahwahnee Ledge.

It takes the full range of skills: tiny cams, aid-to-free, hooking, pendulums, and tons of steep awkwardness for the leader and follower. It used to be a clip-up on fixed gear, but there is not much fixed gear any more. I think I only clipped one fixed head. Practice on A2 thin/C3 stuff. Also, you have a very involved approach and decent.Some notes:-For pitches 1-2 and 3-4, I recommend you know how to place/hand-place beaks-the free climbing to the bolt ladder on the second pitch above Ahwahnee was surprisingly juggy and casual (in free shoes).-I missed to the left turn to Dano ledge and ended up on some sketchy loose free climbing that took me straight to the summit.-the two slab rappels to the top of the chimney have a somewhat devious second anchor. We rapped off of some jingus slung flake for the second rap. Strange. I really don't think we missed anything.-the Sloan guide says use a single 60 for the first 5 chimney rappels. That is BS. You need two ropes to make the final station on rap #5 on the slab just below the chimney to take you to the ground.-The chimney is the most likely place for you to get killed: loose rocks everywhereGreat stuff! Enjoy...Cheers from Osaka,john"", 'Just FYI, when we had to bail and my partner skipped the fourth class by rapping, he made it on a single rope rap of a 60m (dynamic) plus 65m (static haul). Not sure where the 60m + 70m is coming from; perhaps SuperTopo is correct at 400ft.As for the bolt ladder, make sure to use smooth/keylock gates on the hangers; whoever is cleaning will thank you.', ""Descent Notes: Single 60 meter rope will definitely get you all the way to the ground doing the standard chimney/gulley descent. This does involve a little bit of down climbing, maybe 4th/5th class for 10 feet with minimal exposure. Most of the rappells go through loose blocky terrain that I wouldn't want to be pulling down two ropes through (likely to get stuck) It wouldn't be that sweet with a haul bag, but with doing the route in a day it was easy. I didn't find any of the rapping devious or tricky to find anchors in the chimney/gulley system. In the daylight it seemed very straight-forward. On the final rappels down the steep blank wall that take you to the ground there are a few newer looking anchors that make the single 60m rope work. I think a 70 meter rope would eliminate the need to down climb the one section of 4th/5th class.Route Notes: Hooks used - one big grappling, one medium camhook. Didn't hand place any beaks. One fixed copperhead on pitch 3. There was a fixed #3 beak on p4, so maybe carry up one of those in case it's gone."", ""Heads up, the fixed line between Guano and Ahwahnee ledges is completely core shot from rubbing on the rock as of 10/20/2019. Someone attempted to protect it with tape but there is a section that is super thin. We fixed our own rope for traveling back and forth while camping on the ledge and I'd recommend anyone else do the same until someone replaces it. Epic route!"", 'If you are tired of long splitter cracks, clean dihedrals and views of El Cap and Half Dome, this route\'s for you. Flared and irregular cracks, sometimes filled with guano, bolt ladders, and blown heads makes this route an altogether different experience. But I suppose the exposure and classic bivy ledges make up for it all.I concur with the advice of linking 1/2, 3/4, 5/6, 8/9. Older topos note ""fixed"" sections of A1 and ""bad"" bolts. None of that is true today. Almost every bolt has been replaced. Most of the fixed sections aren\'t, at least until reaching a slew of pitons near the top. What was A1 pins is now C2 camming in pin scars. You\'ll want two sets of Aliens and/or Totems or similar. Three sets is better if you are going to link pitches. We needed nothing larger than a #3 Camalot.Our descent via the Leaning Tower Chimney took 9 or 10 raps, all from good anchors, along with two short sections of class 3/4 downclimbing. After a single-rope rap from the summit ridge to a good tree, a 60m rap reaches to within a few feet of the ground (3rd class to reach terra firma). All the raps in the Chimney are from bolted anchors and less than 30m in length, the first two of which are vertical or overhanging. As you exit the Chimney and move a few feet to climbers right, break out a second rope (if you have one) for a 55m rap to the ground. Intermediate anchors exist to break the the two longer raps for those with only one rope. There is some loose rock in the Chimney. The descent could take 4+ hours to reach the parking lot. Probably not something to try for the first time by headlamp. Bivy ledges don\'t get better than the one at the top of Pitch 10.', 'Just topped the route in 8.5 hours 2 days ago. Wall was empty. Linked 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8. linking is the way to go. Plenty of fixed wires in all the right spots.If anyone is up in the near future my partner left my Metolius UL blue #1 cam up by the top of pitch 7. Would appreciate it back if anyone able to grab it. IG:van.ninjaSome of the gear I used and didnt use.Didnt use: nuts, offset nuts, micro nuts, cam hooks.Did use: 2 set of totems, 3 black totems, bd#3, metolius super cam medium, couple tiny cams.I probably placed the black totems 30-50 times, they fit perfect in the pin scars. I did use a couple of the tiny metolius cams. The only hook move I did was on the middle of pitch 1. Dont get confused and clip the 2 fixed micro nuts on the corner, they go nowhere. The only larger cams Ihad than the orange totem was a BD #3 and a metolius super cam. used each twice on the upper pitches. Wall stayed in the shade until about 2pm.The descent gulley sucked, Took 3 hours, we used 2 ropes since it was the first time and just getting dark. Next time probably just use one.', ""Two things I'd add to all the other comments. 1) A hand placed beak a friend lent us was key in two or three places. I wouldn't climb it without one.  2) The descent was very pleasant and a highlight for us: such a cool canyon-like chimney, rappelling behind chockstones. Had the feel of a Utah slot canyon."", ""We did the route according to the Sloan topo from his ebook, which puts it at eight pitches, minus the final scramble to the true summit.We had two sets of Totems, a set of regular cams (mix of aliens and Metolius ultralight master cams) five offset cams, two #3 camalots, two #4 Camalots, a full set of offset nuts from micro to the largest DMM, and regular nuts. Aid gear, we had camhooks, a few beaks of various sizes, a grappling hook and a talon (had a cliff hanger too but that got dropped on the first pitch).I led pitches 1, 2, 4 and 8 as listed in the Sloan book, and my pal Julian had the others.I was glad I had two 4’s for the last pitch. Used both.The totems were clutch. Fit everywhere we placed them. Neither of us took a single lead whip the whole time.For anyone who can do this route without hooks, kudos to you. I had to use a beak and the grappling hook just to get through the C2 section on the first pitch. Wasn’t til afterwards that I re-read a comment here to the effect of “ignore the fixed nut to the left of the first bolt ladder; it goes nowhere.” I clipped it, pulled up to it, and then had to use the beak to be able to reach the hook placement. After that was able to get another totem in and it was over. But that was a funky tricky section.I also used the beak and the hook again on the fourth pitch right off Guano Ledge. There are several blown heads that the beak works great with. Definitely recommend bringing at least one, probably a mid-size pecker, not the larger tomahawks.I never placed any of the offset cams we brought, nor did I use the camhooks or the talon, and I sewed up the pitches I led. My partner and I both wound up using the totems so much that we were able to get plenty of regular cams and (usually offset) nuts in for each pitch, so the offset cams were unnecessary, as long as you have two sets of totems.Also definitely agree this is not really a beginner route so to speak. Though there is a ton of C1 there’s plenty of hooking, C2 and spicy free moves you need to pull, and you need to know how to do a lower-out for following in a few spots. We did it in two days, taking our time. Climbed to Ahwahnee Ledge, left the haul bag, fixed pitches four and five, spent the night on the ledge, then jugged up and did the final three and had plenty of daylight for the descent.On the seventh pitch, we had to leave a fixed Metolius 0 right after the last bolt in the roof. Thing would not budge when I tried to clean it. If you can booty it, enjoy. Just the latest in a ton of fixed pieces all over the route. There were several biners and slings clipped to various pitons and other fixed nuts, heads and the like, on nearly every pitch.Fantastic time. Definitely recommend it. For those on here who say it's less than classic, you must be pretty damn spoiled. Perhaps the most amusing part was my pal dropped his FitBit watch off while leading pitch 7, and got it back because some kind soul found it and placed it obviously on a rock in the middle of the trail heading down. Had a cracked face but worked just fine. Damnedest thing."", ""I would very much suggest using a petzl chest ascender for the first two pitches-- it just makes things a lot more enjoyable given the overhanging nature of the route; I think it is harder to jumar the first two pitches than to lead them.  I climbed the West Face many years ago-- we did not use pins, and we did not have very many small cams (lots of small wired stoppers, mashies, and hooks did the trick).  We did it in 1.5 days.  I remember just one or two hook moves using Harding's bat holes getting up the last few feet to Awahnee ledge.  We also combined pitches to do it in 5 long pitches.  I considered this climb to be a solid C3 aid route, given the ancient gear that we used.  This is not a good first aid/wall route, as somewhat advanced skills are required.  Sadly, exceedingly slow parties have become the norm on the West Face."", 'What an amazing climb. Only bummer is that it ends to soon. There wasn’t much fixed stuff until the last pitch, so be prepared to climb it. Totems(two sets are better than one), cam hooks, hooks, beaks, this goes clean no need to haul a hammer. For some reason I almost missed the hard left to Dano ledge though and started up some wide nonsense. It was like 2 am and I didn’t see the pins in the traverse. I realized my mistake (the rock was still gritty from not being traveled much) and made it to that incredible ledge by downclimbing and getting back on route. The top out is awesome but you don’t want to miss that ledge. There’s a lot of rappelling to get off so bring extra webbing or cord to reinforce the stations, cut out the obviously cooked tat that’s hanging to make room for some new stuff.

Pat & Jack Pinnacle,"Trad, 600 ft (182 m), 8 pitches","Dan McDevitt, Gabriel Mange, Bryan Law. January 2011.","The Super Slacker Highway offers a fun, clean, and moderate multi-pitch outing to the unique summits of both Pat and Jack Pinnacles. The route ascends a wide range of features including perfect hands, balancey face, steep jugs, fingers and chimneys. Short pitches, well-protected crux climbing and comfortable belay ledges make the route very reasonable. An excellent option for getting off the deck on a cool day. P1: Choose your own adventure. Climb either Knob Job (5.10b) or Nurdle (5.8) to a bolted anchor. 30m. P2: Knobs above the belay lead to a crack. Protect here and move left onto the face. Good climbing past a variety of face features leads to a bolted anchor. 5.9. 20m. P3: ""The Boulder Problem"". Climb up and right to the base of a short face. Thin knobs and edges quickly lead to a sloping mantle. Press it out and you're at a bolted anchor. A few draws/slings are all you need for this pitch. 5.10a. 10m. Note: From the anchor at the top of P3 you'll need to move the belay 10m to a tree at the base of the next pitch. Link this with P3. P4: Balance through a knobby face to get established at the base of a right-facing finger crack. Jam and stem your way up the toothy crack until possible to pull onto the slab to the left. Delicate face moves lead past a bolt and up into the overhanging sea of juggy plates and knobs. Crank through this steep, but mellow, section to a bolted-anchor. Semi-hanging belay. 5.10a. 30m. P5: ""Proud Headwall"". A steep pull gets you established on the beautiful knobbed face. Fun moves lead up and right to the base of the ""Big Fin"". Squeeze in and shimmy through the fin to a bolted anchor. 5.10a. 25m. P6: Step right on sloping feet and thin edges. Latch the lip and press through. A short section of off-balance fingers leads to a bolted anchor on a huge ledge. 5.10a. 15m. The plush ledge at the top of P6 puts you in a unique position beneath the Pat and Jack Pinnacles. Each pinnacle is summited via a single pitch off of the ledge. You can either climb, lower and TR each or summit and rap each. The pitches to both of the summits climb on the north face (back side) of the pinnacles. Both pitches share a start. Two options: a.) Direct Start. Boulder through the short block above the bolted anchor. 5.11a. b.) Traverse left to the notch between the pinnacles and climb to the ledge. 5.8. P7: Pat Pinnacle. After selecting a start from the above options, move left to the notch between the two pinnacles. Three-dimensional stemming and chimney moves lead to a bolted face on the north side of Pat Pinnacle. Step across onto the sloping face and climb to the summit. Bolted anchor. 5.9. 15m. P8: Jack Pinnacle. After selecting a start, traverse right to the notch between Jack Pinnacle and the main wall. A nice section of hands and fingers leads to a bolt-protected chimney that opens to wide-stems near the summit of the pinnacle. Pull onto the summit. Bolted anchor. 5.9. 20m.","Doubles to 3.5"". All anchors are equipped with bolts and chains.","['Nice route description and just as I remembered it.  Great exposure, terrific moves and the last pitch is super fun!

I agree with previous commenters that this route really shouldn't be 8 pitches; we had to pitch it out because the party right ahead of us did. Also you definitely don't need a double rack for this, ended up with a lot of unused gear.Note for shorter folks: the move right before the mantle was basically impossible for me at 5'2.
