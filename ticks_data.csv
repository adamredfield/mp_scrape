Lower Right Ski Track is treated as separate climbs, so I am listing them that way. However, I prefer long pitches and chose to climb the both in a single 60M+ pitch. This requires a 60 or 70M rope and a larger rack but is worth the time and effort. On intersection Rock, there are three main cracks running diagonally up and left from the base. These are visible from the North side (from the Hidden Valley Campground) and are called, from right to left, Right Ski Track, Left Ski Track, and Half Track. These are plainly visible in the attached photograph. Right Ski Track is the right-most of the three climbs, and starts as a left-leaning, left-facing dihedral, climbing 60 feet or so to a ledge that may be traversed onto from a scramble up the West end of the Rock. Below said ledge is Lower Right Ski Track (5.10c) . Above this ledge is Upper RST (5.3). Access the climb via Lower RST, or scramble up the shoulder of Intersection Rock from the West End, roping up and traversing out left (East-ward) along a sloping ramp to the crack.

Deal with a few challenges low on the pitch and you'll be rewarded with super fun 5.5 to 5.7 scrambling to the belay; if you're not mindful of rope-drag early the second half of this pitch could be a miserable struggle. Aid or mantel onto a shelf and walk left for twenty feet to a wide gully. It's best if you can just put a piece in the bottom of the gully and walk back and remove the piece you put at the beginning of the traverse - this will help with rope drag and will allow your cleaner to just walk across a lower ledge to start following the pitch. Back at the gully a couple 5.10 or awkward C2 moves on .5 Totems / Camalot gets you to better cracks and easy cruising. Look for a good spot to put your #5 Camalot above a ledge after the fun cracks that will keep your rope straight for the follower (not necessary if the follower is free climbing only if they are jugging) and will give you the confidence to quest left and around and back up to the spacious belay ledge and its 2 bolts. I like to fix the rope to a piece in a crack on the far right of the ledge because there are a lot of edges on the route - there is a bomber finger-sized crack there - i back the rope up to the two bolts of course. Pitch 15. 10c or C2. 140' Cams - All of your cams. Camhook might be useful in case you don't have the right size thin piece or if you cannot reach a higher, bigger placement - it's never harder than 10a/b at the thin spots. Awesome but challenging 5.10 or C2 pitch. Some slick rock for the free climbers and few random thin placements for the aid climbers keep things interesting.

Towering nearly 3000' this route offers 31 pitches of superb climbing right up the middle of the wall. Often referred to as the ""best rock climb in the world"" it is obvious why this route is one of the most sought after big walls in the valley and the world. Most of the pitches on this route are outstanding but with classics such as the ""Stovelegs"", ""King Swing"" and ""Great Roof"" you'll wish it would never end. Although this is a great climb the route is still very demanding, sustained and exposed and not to be taken lightly. Here are a few tips that might improve a parties chances of success and enjoyment on the route. First if you and or your partner(s) can lead 5.10 solidly this will greatly speed up the amount of time it takes to climb this route as a large percentage of the climb is 5.10 or easier. Second study the topo carefully because there are numerous opportunities to either link or use alternate belays in order to skip pitches (a team of three can also skip hauling certain pitches with some good planning). Unavoidable factors are the number of parties on the route and the weather, both of which can make the route not so classic. For pitch by pitch info and topo's the ""Yosemite Big Walls Supertopo"" guide book is highly recommended.","Bring two sets of nuts with offsets, one or two sets of micro nuts with offsets and two or three sets of cams from .5"" to 3.5"".

A continuously steep and strenuous route with some of the best exposure around. The route is technically easy, but can be mentally wearing due to the nature of the climbing. From the very start there is instant exposure. An awesome wall to cut your teeth on. Every pitch can be linked with a 60m rope and the hauling is really easy since the bag is almost always free hanging. Link pitches 1-2, 3-4, 5-6 for sure and it's much quicker. These take very little actual gear. The route goes completely clean unless any fixed heads blow. P1: C1F 120' - STEEP! Follow the bolt ladder straight up to a short C1F bulge that requires some small gear (cams, nuts, cam hooks, to 1""). Continue up the bolt ladder to a hanging belay. P2: C1 80' - STEEP! Continue up the bolt ladder with a few 0.4-1"" placements to an OK/poor stance belay. P3: C2F 5.7 80' - Follow the crack past a few random bolts to a great small ledge belay. Mandatory free move to get onto the ledge itself or a hook move or two. Not to bad, just awkward. P4: C1 5.6 80' - Continue following the crack up off the right side of the ledge and finish up on a bolt ladder that curves left to a mandatory 5.6 free finish onto Guano Ledge. If bivying on Ahwahnee Ledge, move over there and haul from those anchors. If continuing straight up, haul from Guano Ledge. Ahwahnee is a great ledge that slopes into the wall slightly with several good bolts along it for fixing a line. PLUSH P5: C2 100' - From the Guano Ledge anchor make a free move up to clip a high pendulum bolt. Swing right around a corner to aid up a C2 crack. Follow that up to a right leaning small ramp that joins a vertical C1 crack. Follow that straight up to the belay. Don't haul here! P6: 5.7 C1 - Mandatory 5.7 moves off the belay for 20-30' no pro. Not hard, but can be scary in aid boots. Can't bypass with cheat stick unless you've got an extended ""Lovetron"" (ha!). Follow the bolts as they curve left to a hanging belay. No cams needed on this pitch. Do a single haul from Ahwahnee or Guano Ledge. P7: 5.10 or C1 140' - Longest pitch on the route. Straight up the crack off the belay. Gotta back clean a lot or you'll never make it. Only 1 bolt on the pitch and it's sorta shady. Finish on the slab at a poor stance belay. P8: C1 50' - Follow the crack up to the slab to the roof and follow up to the nice anchor. Easy and short P9: C1+F 90' - STEEP and strenuous. IMHO the best / most fun pitch of the wall. Follow the fixed gear straight up a crack and up the roof. Finish on some mandatory 5.6 after clipping some semi hidden pins to get into easy terrain. Finishes on long sloping poor bivy ledge. P10: C2 80' - Break out the 4.5"" (#4 and/or 5 camalot) and be ready to backclean it. This pitch takes all size gear from micro to huge. Finish on a horizontal roof traverse and keep your rope extended so it doesn't wedge in the roof for your second. Finishes on an awesome bivy ledge for 3+. Fix the rope well for your second. The good anchor is 30' from the roof, but there are some intermediate bolts and pins to clip so no one takes the big pendulum ride. P11: 4th class 40' - Easy scramble up and right to the top. Wonder around and find the rap slings off the back after any Hero Shots have been snapped. Other info: The bolt ladders are NOT reachy (Harding was a short dude) It is 430' from the start of the route at the dead tree to the ground (the Supertopo is incorrect and undershoots it by 30'). You'll need a minimum of a 60m + 70m rope and that will just barely make it (so I'm told) Many cracks are filled with birds and nests (swifts?), hence the guano on Guano ledge. If you hang out on Guano Ledge, you WILL be pooped on. The birds are in their cracks at night, dawn, & dusk, which adds a degree of excitement while climbing past them. They mostly just squawk at you though. Don't smack them around! The route is mostly sheltered from storms, except Ahwahnee Ledge. Rapping the route is not that hard, but requires some down aiding and swinging (mostly the first 2 pitches) This is a VERY popular wall, so expect other people.

I always thought that when it was perma-fixed with lines, you didn't necessarily want to draw the crowds. However, the new guidebook is out, the fixed lines are down, and the secret's out! Go climb this thing! It is the best multi-pitch at the grade in Pine Creek! Pitch lengths are all roughly 35m. Belays are all bolted. Many pitches can be linked with a 70m rope. P1, .10b- Start at a left-facing crack at the toe of the buttress. Difficult undercling moves with poor feet get you into easier terrain. Move left across the face, clipping two bolts. Balancy moves get you into the thin, flaring tips crack. Difficulties ease once established in the crack. P2, .7- Head up into the chimney/corner feature. Move towards the roof and bypass on the left. Low angle hand crack leads to a ledge and belay. P3 & 4, .9- Follow the right facing corner, bypassing another roof to the right. Pass and anchor, and continue up through a splitter double crack corner and anchor. To link these pitches with a 70m, you will need to do about 20' of easy simul-climbing. Move 200' through the deep, black chimney. This is 3rd class. Find an anchor on the right side. You are aiming to get back into the right facing feature, only on the right of the black chimney/dike. P5, .7- Continue up the black chimney for 20', then clip a bolt and move right back onto the gold rock. Fun climbing up flakes brings you to another bolt, and a traverse right back into the crack. Find a ledge and belay. P6, .8- Continue up the corner and crack, through a couple overlaps. The belay anchor here is really a rappel anchor, and a long move across a ledge puts you into a better position to belay the next pitch. P7, .10a- Move across a ledge, pulling over a couple short blocks, towards the obvious right facing dihedral. Climb the left hand of the two crack, and move back right at the top of the feature. Continue right, to another right facing corner. Jam your way to another great ledge and belay. P8, .10b- Move up the left hand side of the alcove, traverse right, and pull over the bulge. Be careful through here, as there are still some large loose flakes above the roof. Easy climbing takes you to a bolt, and a cool ""eye"" feature in the rock. Move into a thin, shallow crack. Tricky moves get you established. Continue up the sustained thin crack with good pro (nuts useful). P9, .7- Head up cracks to the right of the anchor, then move left into the chimney feature. P10, .8- Stem across, or chimney up right through wide cracks. A couple awkward moves get you established. Climb the wide cracks on the outside using a mixture of face holds or laybacks. A couple of bolts provide some protection. To descend, rappel the route making 10 35m rappels. Pay attention to a couple of the rappels however. When rappelling P6, try and pull the rope to the right. There is a lot of potential for stuck ropes here.

A continuously steep and strenuous route with some of the best exposure around. The route is technically easy, but can be mentally wearing due to the nature of the climbing. From the very start there is instant exposure. An awesome wall to cut your teeth on. Every pitch can be linked with a 60m rope and the hauling is really easy since the bag is almost always free hanging. Link pitches 1-2, 3-4, 5-6 for sure and it's much quicker. These take very little actual gear. The route goes completely clean unless any fixed heads blow. P1: C1F 120' - STEEP! Follow the bolt ladder straight up to a short C1F bulge that requires some small gear (cams, nuts, cam hooks, to 1""). Continue up the bolt ladder to a hanging belay. P2: C1 80' - STEEP! Continue up the bolt ladder with a few 0.4-1"" placements to an OK/poor stance belay. P3: C2F 5.7 80' - Follow the crack past a few random bolts to a great small ledge belay. Mandatory free move to get onto the ledge itself or a hook move or two. Not to bad, just awkward. P4: C1 5.6 80' - Continue following the crack up off the right side of the ledge and finish up on a bolt ladder that curves left to a mandatory 5.6 free finish onto Guano Ledge. If bivying on Ahwahnee Ledge, move over there and haul from those anchors. If continuing straight up, haul from Guano Ledge. Ahwahnee is a great ledge that slopes into the wall slightly with several good bolts along it for fixing a line. PLUSH P5: C2 100' - From the Guano Ledge anchor make a free move up to clip a high pendulum bolt. Swing right around a corner to aid up a C2 crack. Follow that up to a right leaning small ramp that joins a vertical C1 crack. Follow that straight up to the belay. Don't haul here! P6: 5.7 C1 - Mandatory 5.7 moves off the belay for 20-30' no pro. Not hard, but can be scary in aid boots. Can't bypass with cheat stick unless you've got an extended ""Lovetron"" (ha!). Follow the bolts as they curve left to a hanging belay. No cams needed on this pitch. Do a single haul from Ahwahnee or Guano Ledge. P7: 5.10 or C1 140' - Longest pitch on the route. Straight up the crack off the belay. Gotta back clean a lot or you'll never make it. Only 1 bolt on the pitch and it's sorta shady. Finish on the slab at a poor stance belay. P8: C1 50' - Follow the crack up to the slab to the roof and follow up to the nice anchor. Easy and short P9: C1+F 90' - STEEP and strenuous. IMHO the best / most fun pitch of the wall. Follow the fixed gear straight up a crack and up the roof. Finish on some mandatory 5.6 after clipping some semi hidden pins to get into easy terrain. Finishes on long sloping poor bivy ledge. P10: C2 80' - Break out the 4.5"" (#4 and/or 5 camalot) and be ready to backclean it. This pitch takes all size gear from micro to huge. Finish on a horizontal roof traverse and keep your rope extended so it doesn't wedge in the roof for your second. Finishes on an awesome bivy ledge for 3+. Fix the rope well for your second. The good anchor is 30' from the roof, but there are some intermediate bolts and pins to clip so no one takes the big pendulum ride. P11: 4th class 40' - Easy scramble up and right to the top. Wonder around and find the rap slings off the back after any Hero Shots have been snapped. Other info: The bolt ladders are NOT reachy (Harding was a short dude) It is 430' from the start of the route at the dead tree to the ground (the Supertopo is incorrect and undershoots it by 30'). You'll need a minimum of a 60m + 70m rope and that will just barely make it (so I'm told) Many cracks are filled with birds and nests (swifts?), hence the guano on Guano ledge. If you hang out on Guano Ledge, you WILL be pooped on. The birds are in their cracks at night, dawn, & dusk, which adds a degree of excitement while climbing past them. They mostly just squawk at you though. Don't smack them around! The route is mostly sheltered from storms, except Ahwahnee Ledge.

An experienced climber should have no problem with this, but the ledge below may justify some pause for a novice leader at this level. Get established in the corner and work up past reasonable gear and rock for 30' to intersect the delicious crack above. Start slamming in jams and cams and work your way up past bulges and jutting sections of the crack to the top. As it becomes thinner, the angle lessens to keep it all from 5.9-5.10, sustained.

The first time I climbed this, I stayed mostly left until the long reach below the flake, and then traversed to the right under the flake and back into the right crack until traversing to the flake. The second time around I found you could stem up for a good distance and the gear on the right seemed a lot easier to place then on the hollow crap on the left (although I followed it this time). SPICY! It is at least 8+ if not 9+. P2. Head up 2 off width cracks strait up the corner with some interesting movement and fun climbing. Up higher the left side crack squeezes out and you must stem between it and the now quite wide crack on the right.

It can also be used to ascend Twin Owls with reduced technical difficulty. Due to the above uses, traffic jams may be encountered. It is likely the technically-easiest way (vs Cheechako) to summit the formation. It can be wet and/or cool. In a wet winter, it can have snow or ice. Also, it may be ascended by small climbers as young as six years of age. Approach via the Gem Lake Trail from the Twin Owls parking lot, pass the Lower Twin Owls climbers access trail, go uphill at the Upper Twin Owls climbers access trail (also approaching Gollum's Arch). Go past the trail that splits to the left (to the Roosting Ramp), pass Hen & Chickens, and pass the approach for the East Ridge. Find a deep cleft near a standing, broken off dead tree around on the NE side of Twin Owls ascending a weakness between the East & West Owls. High traffic down this cleft may also make it more obvious. In the near future, access may be out of a westerly trail out of the soon-to-be-built trail from the new (further East) trailhead. Pay some attention to the trail as you ascend, or you will wind up on the old (less preferred by the some) trail. To approach from above, to use this as a descent, you go to the third class saddle area between the summits of Twin Owls (separated by about 100 feet). It can be less-than-obvious. From here you go down a wide, steepening gully 4th class to the NE (towards Gollum's Arch) about 100 feet to a even steeper section, traverse left around a small rib on a slab to a chockstone and what looks like a cave or big rabbit hole. Downclimb through this cave into a dark, narrow, left-angling chimney about 70 feet. If it's too wet or whatever, you can rappel slinging a chockstone above the chimney (better) or the block that you hop over to get into the chimney (worse). It's a funky, slithering rappel. To ascend: P1. Go up the chimney with some loose gravel in spots. About 50 feet up, you reach the first technical challenge with a crack/flare on the right with slicker foot holds on the left. Chimneying can be a bit of a challenge if you are large. Reaching up can be challenging if you are tiny. This can be funky if wet. A hand sized cam works here. Then, just above, you find the 'crux' with smaller holds on a slick slab for a short stretch to a bucket. This, too, can be funky if wet. A yellow TCU/Alien or cam be helpful to protect your second, especially if tiny & inexperienced. Traverse left to the exit of the chimney & belay, 70 feet. P2. Traverse left about 15 feet on a slab around a small rib (exposed for the tiny or timid). Ascend the gully 3rd to 4th class to the saddle. About 120 feet. P3. From here, you can make a 3rd class scramble to the East summit or a more exposed, and somewhat more difficult bit to the West summit block. To descend, downclimb back to the notch.

This is the route that climbs the crack between the right side of the detached pillar and the main buttress of the Owl ( Wolf's Tooth climbs the left side). This is an excellent route, with very sustained climbing on the crack section of pitch one. The bottom is somewhat overhanging hand/fist crack, which opens to offwidth after about 25 feet. The offwidth continues to widen until it becomes a squeeze chimney after about 60 feet. Shortly before the squeeze the crack is too wide for a #5 Camalot. A #3-4 Big Bro could probably be placed here, but this placement may be difficult. I found one section near this point particularly confusing (took two tries) so I would say this is the crux. In general, the offwidth is steep and sustained, so people will probably find different points to be ""the"" crux. At about 60 feet, the crack becomes a chimney, and you can fit inside. The chinney has a reputation for being run out. You can protect it with small gear IF you look around inside it and don't stay way out on the edge. You will not get gear every few feet, but I got several pieces in here. This pitch is easier than Turnkorner's offwidth roof, but it is not your ""average"" 5.9. Placing gear and keeping it out of your way will be strenuous. The thought of falling into the dihedral while leaning out of it is not exactly comforting. Pitch two provides a couple of choices, a 5.7 to the left, or thin 5.9 crack / corner on the right. I have not done the 5.9, but the 5.7 is a nice pitch. Climb turns into a scramble from here.

Wolf's Tooth is the chimney on the west side (the East side is Tiger's Tooth , considerably harder and more serious at 5.9+). However, I cannot recommend highly enough beginning this climb with the route Conad's , a long, vertical hand and fist crack on the Lower Owls that leads right to the pillar's base (described elsewhere). P1. Ascend the strenuous wide crack/chimney, with good protection, and belay just below the top of the pillar.

It lies on the Lower Twin Owls, the large buttress which, suprisingly enough, lies directly below Twin Owls. In fact, when viewed from the parking lot it is difficult to distinguish them. ""Conad's"" is on the small west face of the Lower Owls, and is not visible from the parking lot. Take the Gem [Lake] trail, but branch left after about 50 feet on a marked approach trail that disintegrates all-too-quickly. Bushwhack and scramble up the steep hillside, aiming for the west face. The route is easily identified by a roof-capped inset, about 20 feet high, out of which emerges the long, slightly left-leaning hand crack. Climb it (sustained 5.9 with a short wide section 2/3 of the way up) to a belay directly below the Wolf's Tooth Pinnacle on the Twin Owls. There are usually rap slings around a constriction at the top of the route that allow for a single rope rap back down to the base with a 70 meter rope. A 60 meter rope barely makes it (possibly with minor downclimbing) if you rap uphill from the base of the route. You may want to be prepared to back up the slings with additional cord. Or better yet, continue with Wolf's Tooth (or another route). Alternatively, you can scramble directly down the East Side of the Lower Owls, and then back up to the base of the route. Or, if you brought everything with you, head down the trail that leads to Hen and Chickens Rock at the southeast corner of Twin Owls proper. If you continue on Wolfs Tooth or any other Twin Owls route, you can descend on the west side of the Owls to get back to the base of Conads--the scrambling is confusing and time-consuming, however.

It’s bolted with anchors for 5 short pitches but can be climbed as three long pitches (combine 1 & 2 then 3 & 4). Some parts of it were climbed before the current bolted line went in, but nothing was documented. Start on the clean 4 foot ledge overhanging the creek, 30 feet below and upstream of the start of Solid Gold / Playin' Hooky . It's the second route left of Solid Gold . If you belayer is standing on dirt, you are probably starting up Furlough Day. Pitch 1: climb up and left, then follow some small, left-facing corners. Using the left wall of the corner, you can finesse the roof. Belay above the roof on 2 bolts. Pitch 2: pass a second black overhang to climber's left. Move back right above the overhang. Continue up the bolt line. Staying left of the bolts is easier. For more challenge, climb to the right of the bolts until the last two bolts under the final bulge. Avoid the two huge boulders on the right here, as they may not be attached. Pull through the bulge to the belay. Pitch 3: the friction move below the second bolt is tricky. Clipping may be more secure if you wait until you get the positive hold just above the bolt. The rest of the pitch is mostly easier. Belay on the 2 x 6 foot ledge on another pair of bolts. Pitch 4: from the belay bolts, move left then up past 4 bolts to the big grassy ledge. Walk the ledge right to the double bolts under the right side of the overhang. Pitches 3 & 4 can be combined. Pitch 5: start under the right margin of the overhang, and then steps left (5.7) onto & above it. Enjoy the exposure as you clip the bolts straight up to the skyline. Two bolts 3 feet past the lip support belay at the top. A chain & a bolt at the lip support lowering sport style. This pitch is 35 meters long. You can’t get back to the belay by lowering on a 60m rope, but there is a rap anchor that you can reach on the upper face. Descent: rappel the route. From the top, the first rap is to a mid-face anchor above the belay. A 60 will not reach back to the belay from the top. The second rap will drop you to the Solid Gold / Playin' Hooky rappel anchors. If it’s open, continue down that route. If it’s busy (as it usually is), stay on rap and walk/sidestep over to the P3 anchor of Black Gold. Three more raps will get you down to the base of the cliff. On the last rap, throw the rope towards the Playin’ Hooky start. Throwing the rope straight down may put the rope ends in the creek. Landing this rap at the base of Furlough Day and retrieving the rope from there helps keep the rope out of the creek. If you don't want to rap, follow the climber's trail and cairns that will lead you down the eastern gully and back to the approach trail. It's faster than rapping.

The route is not technically difficult, consisting of mostly 4th-class scrambling but the position and exposure are spectacular. The route follows the top of the ridge nearly the whole way climbing up and over two intermediate summits before topping out on the true summit. Simul-climbing the ridge is probably the best option if you want to go faster and still stay safe. From the low point on the ridge scramble east to the first summit staying near the ridge-crest, sometimes to the south, sometimes to the north but never more than a few yards away. At the top of the first summit follow slabs down to a saddle and then continue up the ridge toward the second summit. Again stay near the crest until you get to a steep section that is avoided by following a ledge to a corner on the north side of the ridge.

Doyle 1981","Excellent and varied climb that felt very solid (I assume due to lots of traffic - but not too much as the limestone has not been polished smooth yet). Kahl Wall tends to wander about so route finding is a challenge. Most of the climbing is moderate so you don't have to be a solid 5.10 climber. The crux pitch is very sustained and much harder then any other pitch on the route, but it is extremely well protected with lots of bolts and occasional gear placements so that no matter what one could get past this pitch. P1 - 35m, 5.4 - Mostly an approach pitch. Scramble up 5m to sloping ledge with tree. Climb steeper corner above on right (5.4) to a ledge system. Traverse left on ledges to many belay stations, use the one farthest left. P2 - 35m, 5.6 - Climb up a few meters in a a corner. At the bolt go STRAIGHT HORIZONTAL left (it is very tempting to keep going up in the larger crack but if you place a cam you're already too high). After a few meters left on a 2nd ledge (optional belay anchors), climb diagonal up-left to another ledge, traverse it straight left till the end to base of a corner and belay here. This pitch is more horizontal then vertical. P3 - 40m, 5.7 - Up corner to ledge. Move right to another corner and up this to another ledge. Traverse right to wide crack and up this to a belay on the right. P4 - 45m, 5.7 - Up to a ledge below a flaring chimney. Up this and near top before you reach the roof, exit right onto ledges. There should be a pin here to protect the 2nd as you now make a long traverse right. At end of traverse step down and across a depression, climb a short corner to ledge. Keep traversing right to a fixed belay. P5 - 30m, 5.8 - From right side of belay, move up to large corner and climb this to a bolt and pin on right. Move right here (5.8) to a left-facing corner. Up this to ledge and move right to a belay. P6 - 35m, 5.10b - Fantastic pitch! Lots of fixed pro so you can concentrate on the sustained, thin face climbing required. Move up to flake and move right around it (1st crux) into tiny corner and continue up steep face to ledge (2nd crux). Climb the corner above you till it becomes featureless, at which point step right to a slabby face, move up it to a roof and then step back left into the corner you had exited below. Continue up corner to fixed belay. P7 - 30m, 5.9 - Climb corner above for 15' or so and then step right into groove and then step right again to easier ledges. Climb up and right past a pin and right some more to base of slab. Excellent climbing up this slab past fixed gear leads to a belay beneath the huge exit corner (easily seen from the base of the climb). P8 - 45m, 5.8 - Up the corner. Crux is moving left when you reach a roof. Easier if you stay in the chimney as you move around roof as opposed to just using the main wall. P9 - 20m, 5.8 - Finish up the corner which requires your 4"" cam to minimally protect. Turn the roof at the top of the corner and easier climbing leads to the top. Lots and lots of loose rocks on top so be very careful as you belay up the second.

It is very attractive to the everyperson's climber who looks at the 5.6 grade, 11-12 pitches, 1500 ft of climbing, a direct line to the summit, and says ""I'm there."" However, there is more than what meets the eye to this climb. A rope, a helmet, and decent sense of routefinding are advisable for this line. There are stray bolts, stray gear, stray anchors to lead you astray. This face can gets sun in July and shorts can work. At 10am the route is in full sun. P1. This is described as 3rd-4th class with optional ropework. I recommend a rope. No pro, low angle, loose rock, 160'. 1 bolt anchor (10y ago). Don't fall. P2. This continues up with loose rock on ledges, 1 Friend placement, balance required, 160'. 2 bolt anchor. ""Loose as sin"" is what my notes say. Don't fall! My buddy did, but fortunately it was following. P3. Pretty much straight up to a 3 bolts belay. Much more solid rock. Route finding apparently can be challenging on this pitch. P4. Go up and right to a shaded, right-facing corner/groove. A belay that we used is up and right from the top of the groove. 3 bolt belay. There is another, bolted belay to the left that we didn't use. 5.2. P5. This is a tricky pitch for route finding (probably the crux of route finding). Don't go up and right (that felt 5.8+ R before I downclimbed)! We went down, then traverse left to a ledge, curve up to a groove, to a 2 bolt belay on a ledge. P6. Angle right, continue past quite a few bolts & pins, go up to a ledge. This may be the crux pitch. 40m, 5.6. P7. Go up ~7m, then go left, get up under a small roof, continue up to a 2 bolt belay. My notes suggest you may pass a bolt & 3 pins. P8. Traverse up and right, then go up the right side of a rib, finish in a small, left-facing corner to a 2 bolt belay. 5.5. P9. Go up a nice, left-facing corner/slab, pass 3 pins, belay at a 2 bolt belay. This is probably the nicest pitch, IMHO. It is easier than it looks. This pitch is in the shade in the afternoon. This sweet photo shows climbing left of the dihedral, although I recall climbing closer to the dihedral at points. 5.5. P10. Go up and left to a 3 crack corner.

Super easy climbing but extremely run out. We burned about 5 1/2 hours on a casual stroll up getting lost once. Speedier climbers could half that easily. Descent: slip down the back side on the scree. Alternatively, I've heard you may be able to rap Sisyphus Summits, but we didn't do that.

Looking directly across Elbow Lake at Eenie , this route takes the longest line up the face. Upon reaching the base of the wall, there will be a cairn marking the start of the route. Pitch 1 starts off a corner system to a ledge, where it turns slightly right and follows a moderate crack (5.7) for 150' to a large grassy ledge. This pitch can feel more difficult if wet. Pitch 2 From the ledge follow a corner system (5.6) up several large steps to a large ledge. You will need to traverse until under the 3rd pitch. The first 2 pitches can be combined with some good rope management and a bit of simu-climbing. Make sure not to start the 3rd pitch too far left. Pitch 3 will start with a weird squeeze move to a stance marking the start of a right tending hand crack. Follow this crack through a small roof and up a finger crack till another roof is encountered. Step up and over the roof on to a slab face which is a bit run out. This is the crux of the pitch (10a). Pitch 4 Continue up the face following a small closed seam until you are able to traverse right under a large roof on hollow flakes. Once around the roof, easier climbing follows to a large ledge system below the giant dihedral system. There is another slightly runout section before the ledge, but climbing is easy (5.7). It is also possible to belay before this section, on top of the large roof. If belaying on large ledge at the start of the dihedral pitch it is possible to combine it into one long 200' pitch, if not it will need to be broken up at a ledge half way up. The first half of this pitch goes at 5.8 and is very fun to climb. The second half is a bit harder (5.9) with interesting gear placement that will make you think all the way up. This pitch ends on a down and right sloping ledge and will require some ingenuity to build a good anchor among all the loose blocks. For the next pitch you will need to head up the ramping ledge until it is possible to turn right and climb up some loose blocks to a good stance and a short finger/hand crack. Continue up and right on easier climbing over short faces and ledges ending at a large ledge and belaying at a large detached block. This marks the start of the crux pitch and the half way point. From here it is easy to bail if you get into trouble with time or weather. It is possible to sling the large block at the start of the 6th pitch and double rope rappel to the 3rd pitch ledge. From here traverse to the right until it is possible to sling another horn for one of the most exciting rappels, 150' of hanging in space as you descend into the couloir between First Buttress and Eenie. Pitch 6 is the 6th crux pitch is a spectacular hand to finger crack broken up by a large roof and a ledge. Start by climbing on-top of the large block, head up a hand/finger crack to a large roof. Hand traverse the roof to the right, #3 or #4 camalot useful, till possible to climb on ledge to the right. You can belay here in order to reduce rope drag but is not necessary. Continue up a finger crack to another large roof, where it is possible to traverse left into another finger crack. Step up the and through the bulge until it is possible to transfer back right to another finger crack and a fix nut (crux 5.11b). Continue up the crack and face until you reach a large sloping ramp below the Prow, belay here. Pitch 7 heads straight up the ramp to the corner of the Prow. Rope drag can be bad on this pitch so it is not recommended to place gear until about to turn the corner around the Prow. Once on the backside (north) of the Prow climb 20' up a face and traverse left to a ledge system below a 9th pitch hand crack. It is also possible once around the Prow to continue left, staying low until a thin seam is reached, directly below the ledge and pitch 8. This is a not recommended variation going at 5.10 R/X. The next pitch is one of the best of the route. Start up a finger crack, climbing on top of a large detached flake. Head straight up this amazing left trending hand crack that continues to get steeper the higher you get (10d-11a). Pull over a bulge to the left and continue the face and broken cracks to another ledge. From here a short traverse back right and around will put you onto a nice sloping ledge on top the Prow. Once here there are 2 possibilities: the first is to go up a wide crack on the right (5.8) and make a airy traverse back to the finger crack on the right. The second, which I would recommend, is a great 5.10 variation which heads straight up the finger crack. Right of the ledge a 5.10 move is required to pull over a small bulge and into the finger crack. Once in the crack easier climbing follows (5.8) through the finger crack and a OW with a hand crack in the back. This will lead you to a small ledge and the start of the 11th pitch. Pitch 11 follows a hand crack in a corner and then up easier 5th class scrambling. Pitch 10 and 11 can also be combined into one pitch but watch for rope drag. From here only moderate 5th class scrambling is required to reach the meadow, which also leads to the true summit if desired. If you have made it this far pat yourself on the back, as you have just completed one of the longest technical routes in Montana. Hopefully you have also made it to the top with a little light to spare, as teams have been forced to bivy here before. The descent is somewhat involved and exposed, so be careful. Start by climbing up the grass field until possible to traverse right. Continue heading right until a very exposed corner is reach, climb up and left over a short face and back down to the grassy ledge. Continue right until finally over the saddle between Eenie and the First Buttress. A short exposed down climb leads to a slung horn for the first rappel requiring 2-60m ropes or a single 70m. After the first rappel to a ledge there are two options, to the climber's right a single 35m rap leads to the descent gully. To the climber's left is another rappel, I do not know if this is possible with a single 70m, but it looks to lead down to the opposite side of the couloir (west) which you do not want to go down. Scramble down the couloir towards a small lake watching out for cliffs as they tend to be everywhere. Once on level ground again head south west and back to Elbow Lake.","A double rack through #3 Camalots, double set of nuts, many slings single and double length.

The first pitch, a classic finger crack, is a great start to a very memorable route. It is a clean finger crack 5 feet to the right of a classic arete. It lies in a sort of groove which lends it nicely to stemming. Make some 9-ish moves to get to a small rest stance halfway up the crack. Getting off this rest stance is supposedly the 11a crux of this pitch. The moves off the rest are accomplished by stemming in the groove and using a small edge for your left hand. Once in the crack, the finger jams are very good yet the steep sustained nature pumps you out for one last 5.10 move to the two-bolt belay. This last move, while not very hard in and of itself, is definitely the crux of this beautiful pitch. This pitch protects very well with small stoppers and TCUs. If this pitch felt hard, remember that the last two are significantly harder and more involved. The second pitch is just as classic, if a tad spicy. Begin with twenty feet of unprotected 5.8 slab up to a bolt just right of the arete, climb for twenty more feet up to another bolt (5.8) and step around left to the other side of the arete. This deposits one at the base of a left-angling crack. Crank up this crack a little ways to an ok stance. A good #1 Camalot can be placed at the base of this crack, but this piece will be below your feet for the crux move off a sloper. A fall off this move would throw you back around the arete and wouldn't be too pleasant. For this reason, some guidebooks give this pitch an R rating. Perhaps it is if you are incompetent at placing stoppers; there is a textbook RP placement right in your face for this move, this placement eliminates any s rating this pitch might have. The belay at the top is double bolt on a stance on the arete. All of the pitches on this route are approximately a half ropelength (80-90 feet) and some can be combined. However the rope drag would be heinous. The third pitch is 5.8. It heads up the right side of the arete to a mantle onto a juggy hold. It is the easiest pitch, and if for some reason you are taking a second who leads in the 5.9 range, you might be inclined to let him lead this pitch. Be aware that it would be a pretty runout lead. This pitch wanders quite a bit, and long runners are needed to alleviate rope drag. Set the belay at the base of a rotten ramp/alcove deal. From here the fourth pitch should be obvious, a right-leaning dihedral that turns into a chimney with a roof at the top. This is where the climbing gets intense. The initial dihedral is a thin 10c affair, and has a pin protecting the hard move. Gear can be had below the pin, and while this pin is not great, it is adequate for the move. The dihedral takes you up and right into some underclings where you encounter a second pin. This pin is definitely suspect. I have heard many wildly varying accounts of this pitch. Rossiter gives it an s rating in his latest guidebook because of this piton. I have heard people telling me it was a death pitch. None of this is true. A small purple Metolius TCU can be placed below the pin, together these two pieces provide adequate protection, and a fall from the crux onto them would be reasonable. One could probably back these pieces up even more if so inclined. This is definitely not a death pitch, it is only mildly spicy. From this last pin, intricate moves lead up and into the chimney. I couldn't identify a single crux; there are about four or five very technical moves to get situated in the chimney. The hardest might entail hiking your right foot up onto a left-angling rail. Once in the chimney, you can clip a pin below the roof and back it up with some small stoppers and a blue Metolius TCU. Resting before the roof is very awkward as you are very scrunched in this chimney. The next moves are 10c/d, I believe they are considered harder now because of a missing flake. At any rate, crank right around the roof with poor feet. This will feel hard after the endurance required for the rest of the pitch. The belay is obvious, a three-bolt affair below a right-angling ramp. This pitch can be considered 11b overall; it is very technical and sequency climbing. Ahh the fifth pitch! Begin with an 11a move onto the ramp. Rossiter calls this the crux, yet I thought the bombay chimney was quite a bit harder and more involved. The bomber fixed gear here eases the strain of the climbing. Once on this ramp, you are led up and around the arete to an awesome, spectacular, overhanging hand crack with some fixed pro at the base. With a #1 Camalot, two #2s, and one #3, this final crack will be completely sewn up, a very important thing to to for your second. If they fall here it would be hard to get back on. This final crack is the final blow for the leader. I suspect that seconding this thing is quite a bit easier, placing pro on it is very strenuous. Next to the bombay chimney, I thought this was the second hardest part. The crack in and of itself is maybe 10b/c, yet feels very strenuous on lead, and after the initial crux section of the pitch it is very pumpy. Indian Creek climbers will enjoy this section. It consists of liebacking on good hand jams in small flares. Fire up this section to a wider, yet easier section, and get a belay right at the top of the crack in order to keep a close eye on your second. Overall, this pitch is 11b too, and is probably one of the most spectacular in Eldo with 600 feet of air below you! From here, a final easy (5.6) pitch leads to the top.","The protection on this route is creative in places, yet never really a problem. Bring a healthy number of stoppers and TCUs, and only a few cams in the larger sizes. A #3 Camalot is helpful for the final handcrack.","Jul 16, 2024  ·  Follow. Finally got on the edge.

To approach, hike up the Bastille descent trail past the West Buttress , past Blind Faith , and past Breakfast in Bed .

Start up the face to the left of the crack, wander up to a pin in a bulge and follow the line of bolts through the roof and up the face above all the way to the walk-off ledge for The Bastille Crack . This pitch has surprisingly awesome rock, really good pro (it's bolted) and killer moves. I'm tempted to give it three stars, but I think we give too many things three stars on this site that may not quite deserve it. Fred Knapp stated in his Best of Boulder Climbs guide that this has become a ""classic de jour"" and I can see why. I loved this route. The crux is short and it's near the bottom of the route. A lot of guides call this .11c or .11b/c, but I think it's a little easier, maybe even .11a if you're comparing it to T2 or something. Anyhow, after the crux is over the route continues to deliver with absolutely awesome movement up the steep face on better than could be hoped for holds. Definitely worth a go if you're up on the Bastille. Oh, and many guides also note the optional light rack to supplement the bolts.

This is on the S.E. corner of the Saber, left of the Kor Route and Right of the SW corner. The climbing can be generally summarized as good moves on good rock and occasionally lacking protection, but not where it matters. Cruxes are reasonably well protected and also vary in difficulty upon the precise line taken. P1-2, 5.6, 500': Make your way up the SE end of the Saber on moderate and easy terrain (5.6, tops) to the big ledge form where start the various technical routes. This is generally done with some soloing or simul-climbing but represents at least 3 belays without any. You can also climb Snively-Harlin (10b) to get there. P3, 5.8, 80': Same as for the first 'hard' pitch of the Kor Route. Move out to the right of the ledge and to the base of the short, shallow, broken left-facing corner, which is only about 50 feet tall when viewed from below. Climb this to its end and a little past to reach a ledge above. This pitch is best run directly into the next pitch and can easily be done as such if you have the rack for it and placed (or did not place) to avoid drag. P4, 5.10, 100': Step left into a long right-facing corner, and climb this up to a ledge and belay (as for the SW corner, remarkably!). P4a, 5.10, 100': (Alternate option A) Step slightly right and climb up the face for a bit into a second right-facing corner, this one a hanging corner with a small roof below it. It ends after perhaps 10 meters, and you climb up and left into an easier corner and face, which joins the standard pitch 4. P4b, 5.10, 100': (Alternate option B) Continue out and right on the ledge from the belay of P3, climbing face just to the right of the arete. This can be climbed to a ledge near the end of your rope, with some cracks just to the right of the arete. If you do this, you will be forced into a alternate pitch for P5 as well- see the ""Razor's Edge"" variation route. P5, 5.9, 160': Join the SW corner route for this pitch. Climb up and left to a left-leaning crack and then continue below a large roof, going left under it to a left-facing corner, then up the corner to a sloping ledge. Better yet, follow the more direct line ""Razor's Edge"" for a very long pitch and to the summit, having climbed the variation of P4 which accesses it. P6, 5.9, ~150': Climb up and right on cracks and face to reach the right-facing corners nearest the SE edge of the face. The Kor route is to the right and around the corners, out of sight. This pitch may be continued until you reach a suitable belay, or run out of rack or rope. P7, 5.9, ~120': Continue up the corner system to the low-angle summit edge of the rock. Find a belay here, and DO NOT try to go to the initial summit's anchors, and the terrain is low angle and rough and will give horrible drag, even unprotected (I have done this a few times, with terrible results). P8, 5.easy, R, 70': Romp up the low angle ledge with the Petit Grepon on your left and the now strikingly beautiful 'Foil' on your right. Go up and over the initial summit to a belay or rap station on its North side. Begin the descent from this anchor or continue with a single rap to the notch and continue to the somewhat distant True Summit which is accessed by Kor Route.","A standard alpine rack, erring on the heavy side. Stoppers, cams from thin to 3.5"" and lots of slings. If you take enough gear, there are virtually no sequential pitches that can not be combined with a little improvisation. Someone rearranged the infamous top anchor since I did in May. They have added some cord on a second pinnacle and bound this to the sling I put on the summit. While this is probably stronger than how I left it, they removed the good fixed stopper on the right (BD #8 or 9). This anchor still needs a little more work. The two slings are presently joined with a third sling which is rapped from. There are single points of failure in this that could still produce ""very exciting"" results, or in the case of the adjoining sling, deadly ones. The stopper should be replaced and tied into the anchor and/or the slings should be made redundant, particularly the low one from which the link is hanging. Sorry I did not do this- I took gear to make it happen, but a storm was coming in, and speed was our most immediate concern.","Jul 13, 2024  ·  Lead / Onsight. Simuled first block to ledge.

Hike up the Gash, which is the large boulderfield between you and the rock. As you get near, there will be a long fin of rock coming off the northeast ridge and heading, guess which direction...northeast. Climb to the east of that and scramble up on some large ledges for the first pitch. P1. The first pitch can start in several places that are all about 5.4-5.6. I'd say we ran about 160 feet of rope on the first pitch. There are probably several places you could rig a belay. P2. The second pitch was similar to the first 5.4-5.6 climbing, about the same distance and straight up the northeast ridge. Not a lot of zigzagging on this route. After some initial 5.5 climbing a long section of 5.easy climbing leads to a crux layback flake (<10ft). Belay on top of the flake. On this pitch the terrain gets easier if you stay left, but avoid the temptation and go straight up. You will eventually see the flake. Alternatively if you veer left a bit you can find a good belay stance on a dirt/grass covered lege below and left of the flake about 30-50 feet and save the flake for the next pitch. P3. The third pitch goes 5.6 in the guidebook. Startup up a left-facing dihedral, and go more or less straight up, or possibly slightly right along a system of left facing dihedrals. The crux is just before the belay. 100-150'. P4. Go up and slightly right along 5.easy terrain. Just before the end of the pitch there's a nice right slanting finger crack. Reach the first ledge/bench on the route and build the belay on the far side next to or in the wide crack. This pitch could likely be linked with the next with a 60m. P5. Pitch 5 starts up a wide crack, but I hung out on the face for most this, because I think offwidths are about as fun as getting beaten with a rubber hose. The climbing is a lot easier on these last two pitches. Also, the route is completely obvious here as well. The 5th pitch ends on another, somewhat smaller ledge. More people on the Petit...if only they knew what they were missing over here. P6. On the 6th pitch, there was little more loose rock and hollow holds, so be a little more cautious. From the top of #6, it's a very simple scramble to the summit. Ok, I was roped up, so what?, but honestly, it's probably Class 2 to the top from here. So, some may consider it 5 pitches. The top has a great view of the surrounding area. Also, a little less comforting, look down through the boulders on the summit on the west side. I swear I saw daylight through there. Anyway, head southeast from the summit and down a little gully to rap rings. There are 3 50-60 meter raps to the top of the Gash here. The rap rings looked pretty good. Don't forget to bring a second rope or you'll be downclimbing. Also, there seems to be a lot of loose rock that gets knocked down when you toss your ropes on each rappel so be prepared to shout ""ROCK!!"" often to the people below and watch for more of it when you pull your ropes. That's it. Down the Gash to the trail. Hope you enjoy it. Also, I gave this a grade III, because it took us 13 hours, but we took a 2 mile detour by going to the south side first and then backtracking around to the north side. It's probably somewhere between a II and a III. For an efficient party: Base to summit time: 4 hours. Approach: 3 hours. Descent from summit to base: 90 minutes.

Follow this to where the headwall slopes back to a slab. Belay here, 10a/b, ~120 feet.) P7-9. Work your way over to the North Ridge , and follow that route to the top. I called the route 10- because of the short crux, but it is graded as high as 10c in other guidebooks. The crux is only 2 or 3 moves, but the feet are kind of insecure. I've heard P4 compared favorably to P2 of Over the Hill in Eldo, and I have to agree. It is easy to climb too high on P5 in search of a better belay stance.

Pat Ament has had many first ascents in Eldorado, but few are as perfect and fun as this one. Begin perhaps 20 feet left from the start of C'est La Morte . The first tricky face moves begin from a nice, flat rock. Then enter a broken crack system and move up past one bolt, a fucked-up knifeblade (no longer there) that [was] a perfect example of horrible fixed pro, and past one more bomber bolt right below the crux, which takes you up a hollow flake. The first set of anchors are 20 feet past the crux. From here you can lower, 75 feet, or continue up through an easy A shaped roof and then do an airy traverse left to another set of anchors, 100 feet. This sets you up for the second pitch, if you're up to it.... The second pitch really has to be done if you want the fully C'est La Vie experience. Go straight up the huge dihedral. The 5.11c crux is only about 10 feet above the belay, which sits on a small ledge. Two fixed pins ripped recently so there is virtually no pro to keep you from cratering on the ledge if you rip, but many argue it is well worth the risk. From the top, rap to the first set of anchors and then to the ground. Per Bill Briggs : The route has an exhilarating third pitch that is sadly neglected because the double bolt anchor at the top of the second pitch was not placed at the original finish of the second pitch. Now everyone lowers off the bolts and misses the third pitch. The climb should be completed as follows. Clip the bolts at the top of the second pitch dihedral, then climb another 20 feet to a good stance beneath a six-foot overhand; good anchors can be found here. The third pitch surmounts the overhang with the help of some solution pockets above the lip and a heel hook. Once standing on the lip of the overhang, a medium cam can be placed in a solution pocket. Two more tricky moves up and right lead to easier climbing. The moves are probably 5.10.

Often crowded, a weekday is probably the best time to attempt this climb. The climb is north facing and in the shade until mid-afternoon. As Jim Erickson said in his classic 1980 Rocky Heights guidebook, ""avoid it like the plague if the weather is not warm, or you will shiver away much of its charm."" Start at the center of the north face of the Bastille, below a hand crack that starts 20' up the wall, with a huge, serrated flake to its right. The first pitch has been the site of numerous accidents, so make sure you're solid on 5.7 crack climbing and placing pro before attempting to lead it. P1. 5.7, 60'. Climb up to the flake and step left to the crack. Jam or layback up the polished crack (crux), then follow the crack up and left to a small stance at a 2-bolt anchor with chains. You can belay here (if you want to watch/coach your second through the crux), or continue with the second pitch. P2. 5.6, 90'. Climb up to the chimney left of the bolts, and step left onto the face. Climb up to a finger crack, then traverse right above a little roof (crux). Continue up steep, enjoyable cracks and angle up left on easy ground to a sloping ledge by a steep wall. Belay at a crack with a fixed pin. If this belay is occupied, it's possible to belay about 20' lower at another stance. Variation: near the top of P2, take a right-angling wide crack up and back left, 5.8. Bring a big cam (#4 Camalot) to protect this line. P1 & P2 can be combined with a 50m rope. P3. 5.7, 50'. Climb up into a pod, then work up past a small roof (crux). Continue up the cracks to another sloping ledge. A #1 and #2 Camalot are useful for the belay anchor. P1-3 can be combined with a 70m rope. P4. 5.6, 100'. Traverse left to a short corner with a destroyed fixed pin. Continue traversing left on awkward, off-balance moves past another fixed pin (crux). Go all the way left to a hand crack and climb it to a corner. Don't start up too soon or you'll be off route on a harder variation. Climb the corner, then continue up and right on easy ramps to a belay stance below or just right of a chimney. P5. Several options here: a. Easy finish: 5.4, 60'. Climb the chimney to the top. b. Fun finish: 5.8, 80'. Climb up a ramp right of the chimney to a huge corner with a wide crack. Climb up the face left of the corner to a fixed pin. Continue up the steep headwall and surmount a little roof at the top (crux). If you have a #3 and #4 Camalot, you can belay just above the roof (and watch/coach your second at the crux roof), otherwise continue up an easy gully and belay from a spike of rock at the top. c.

Go 30' right (west) and then follow the marked Bastille descent trail north and down to the road at the base of the cliff. (Ed.

FFA: Stan Shepard, Allen Bergen, 1957","One of the most classic climbs in the country, it begins right off the road on the Bastille, a 350' cliff on the left as you enter the canyon. Often crowded, a weekday is probably the best time to attempt this climb. The climb is north facing and in the shade until mid-afternoon. As Jim Erickson said in his classic 1980 Rocky Heights guidebook, ""avoid it like the plague if the weather is not warm, or you will shiver away much of its charm."" Start at the center of the north face of the Bastille, below a hand crack that starts 20' up the wall, with a huge, serrated flake to its right. The first pitch has been the site of numerous accidents, so make sure you're solid on 5.7 crack climbing and placing pro before attempting to lead it. P1. 5.7, 60'. Climb up to the flake and step left to the crack. Jam or layback up the polished crack (crux), then follow the crack up and left to a small stance at a 2-bolt anchor with chains. You can belay here (if you want to watch/coach your second through the crux), or continue with the second pitch. P2. 5.6, 90'. Climb up to the chimney left of the bolts, and step left onto the face. Climb up to a finger crack, then traverse right above a little roof (crux). Continue up steep, enjoyable cracks and angle up left on easy ground to a sloping ledge by a steep wall. Belay at a crack with a fixed pin. If this belay is occupied, it's possible to belay about 20' lower at another stance. Variation: near the top of P2, take a right-angling wide crack up and back left, 5.8. Bring a big cam (#4 Camalot) to protect this line. P1 & P2 can be combined with a 50m rope. P3. 5.7, 50'. Climb up into a pod, then work up past a small roof (crux). Continue up the cracks to another sloping ledge. A #1 and #2 Camalot are useful for the belay anchor. P1-3 can be combined with a 70m rope. P4. 5.6, 100'. Traverse left to a short corner with a destroyed fixed pin. Continue traversing left on awkward, off-balance moves past another fixed pin (crux). Go all the way left to a hand crack and climb it to a corner. Don't start up too soon or you'll be off route on a harder variation. Climb the corner, then continue up and right on easy ramps to a belay stance below or just right of a chimney. P5. Several options here: a. Easy finish: 5.4, 60'. Climb the chimney to the top. b. Fun finish: 5.8, 80'. Climb up a ramp right of the chimney to a huge corner with a wide crack. Climb up the face left of the corner to a fixed pin. Continue up the steep headwall and surmount a little roof at the top (crux). If you have a #3 and #4 Camalot, you can belay just above the roof (and watch/coach your second at the crux roof), otherwise continue up an easy gully and belay from a spike of rock at the top. c. Grovel finish: 5.7, 80'. Climb the wide crack in the corner just right of the previous variation. To descend: follow deep grooves to the south until you reach a dirt trail. Go 30' right (west) and then follow the marked Bastille descent trail north and down to the road at the base of the cliff. (Ed.

Lightning Bolt Crack is listed in Rossiter as a variation to Mail Ridge. Supposedly it looks like a lightning bolt from some angles, but the crack you climb is pretty much straight up. It is visible from the base of Mescaline up right at the top of the cliff. It is the left facing wall at the top of the Mail Ridge buttress. The top pitch and crux of Handcracker Direct is around the corner to the right. Just left of Lightning Bolt Crack is a V-chimney, the top pitch of Mail Ridge. Approach via Dead Letter Department (5.8--this would be a good combination at that grade), Mescaline, or various other climbs in the area. You can also do this after descending the initial gully after doing Hand Cracker Direct. Belay below the crack below a rotten red band. Climb carefully through the red band to the base of the crack. The crack is overhanging here, but there is a big loose, thin flake you can stand on. Be careful! From the top of the flake layback off jams a few moves to get established in the crack. Above this there are a few footholds on the arete to the right, but they quickly run out as the crack widens and flares. But the good jams continue, at least for your left hand. A few more moves bring you to a Thank God bucket and horizontal crack. That's the end of the crux section. From this point, using the arete on the right for a few moves seems easiest, then back to the crack to pull up into a very nice belay alcove. This is the same belay spot as for the top of the Handcracker Direct crux pitch. Easier climbing at about 5.5 leads up a corner/crack system to the top. Descend to the north, down a gully, and then walk off, carefully, to the north, above the Mescaline wall.

P3 : This pitch is either about 5.7 A0 or 5.11-. Head up and right from the belay. There are some fixed pro and cam placements as you do the first part of this pitch. You get a nice body stem to access the arete/face that takes you upward toward the summit. The face/arete (11- or A0) is basically a bolt ladder where some bolts are relics and others are decent-looking. This accesses a ledge, which you traverse to the left before gaining the belay. You are totally uncool to your second if you don't put a #2 Camalot in the crack at the back of this ledge after doing the bolt ladder.

However the climbing is excellent, certainly as good as many other 4 star routes. The route starts near the NE corner of the Bastille, right off the road and about 50 feet east of The Bastille Crack . Walk just past the first steep buttress ( March of Dimes buttress--about 50 feet high) that lies on the road, 100 yards or so west of the parking lot. The route starts just right of a 40 foot, large rotten dihedral formed by the west edge of March of Dimes buttress. P1. Climb up flakes and blocks for 25 feet, then move up and right (tricky pro) to a lieback, right-facing flake that leads to a small ledge at 50'. Take care in the first 50 feet as there is a lot of hollow rock; there have been some bad accidents/groundfalls in this section. From the small ledge, follow a beautiful thin crack and shallow corner. Belay from bolts on a sloping ledge about 120 feet up. I recommend stepping left to the ledge 5 feet or so before the crack ends (especially if your second isn't solid--the bolts are not on top of the crack), (5.8+). P2. Traverse 15 feet left across the ledge to an obvious, right leaning crack/slot (moving the belay if desired). Climb that for 50 feet (crux, with perfect hand-jamming and awkward feet). Belay on another large ledge. Above is the beautiful 5.10c finger crack of March of Dimes (easily combined with P2 of Werk Supp for a superb pitch of varied crack climbing); climb that, or traverse off to the east into a gully. From the gully, either head down to rap slings around trees (sketchy, not recommended), or boulder up a large chockstone and continue heading east. A rough path through the talus spits you out at the upper end of the parking lot. If you finish on March of Dimes , you can rappel 80' from chains to the top of P1, then rappel 120' to the ground. From the top of P1, a 70m rope reaches the ground. With a 60m rope, you'll have to do a short, slightly sketchy downclimb. However, with a 60m, you can rap climber's left to the top of the first pitch of March of Dimes and then again from there to the ground. Be aware of parties climbing up, if you rap directly down the route - this is a very popular single pitch, and, if you rap left of the route, be aware of, and stay out of, the loose chimney/gully between Werk Supp and the March of Dimes buttress.","For the first pitch a standard rack to a #2 Camalot.

Friends of mine were at Eldo last Memorial Day weekend and said it was dead. That was not the case this year. If the first pitch we did didn't have a semi-gully section, this route would get another star. This route starts to the left of Werk Supp . The start is about even with the chain anchors on top of the pillar that people with one rope use for rappel #2 off the first pitch of Werk Supp . The first pitch (about 5.9) follows a thin crack after doing some face moves lower. Protection is better than it looks from the ground. Continue past the chain anchors, up some less than aesthetic climbing and belay on the ledge at the base of a thin layback crack. Ascend this crack to its end (10 foot, 8+/9-), move right a bit, and head up varied climbing to another belay ledge. From this ledge, head right to the crux thin, left leaning crack (10). The crux is well-protected. At the end of the crack, move up and right on a low angle, wide dihedral to join the The Bastille Crack .

Lightning Bolt Cracks is one of the undisputed must-do ultra-classic desert towers and would be worth doing for the summit alone even if the climbing was total crap. The position rivals the final pitch of the Naked Edge. The route can be done in 3 or 4 pitches (or even 2, for some)--many different belays are possible. P1-start on the right side of the east face in the beautiful splitter crack (fingers to chimney). The left crack is 5.11+ and also very pretty. I thought the real crux of this pitch was not at the beginning (rated 5.11a), but the overhanging, somewhat difficult to protect moves into the awkward leaning slot (rated variously 5.9 or 5.10) above. There is a questionable small wire left of the slot if you don't have a big cam. One can belay directly above the slot (big cam, chockstone) or traverse left at 5.9+ and belay in a V-slot with mediocre rock but a better stance. P2-two options-thin 5.11 fingers widening to splitter off-hands over a roof on the right, or 5.9 flared chimney widening to off-fists over a roof on the left. I took the left, which is rated 5.10, although fairly burly by Creek 5.10 standards. You can also start up the left slot and sneakily traverse right to the splitter off-hands which apparently is the easiest way to do the pitch. Belay above the roof if desired (medium-large friends and/or more fixed delectables), or it is better to continue up and left (5.10-) in the acute corner to a spectacular belay just under the bombay chimney/roof. P3-An unnerving spectacle: turn the huge roof (amazingly, only 5.10) into good hand jams; follow the cracks through progressively worse rock to the base of the final chimney. Optional belay here (small cams needed) or continue into the final squeeze chimney to the summit (rope drag shouldn't be an issue here as you'll be inching your way up anyway). Enjoy one of the best views of your life, then rappel.","Bring a double set of camming devices from tcus/small aliens to a number four friend. A number four camalot can be useful, and a number five camalot [edit: old size - so now, a number 6] helps in protecting the first pitch slot but plenty of people do the route without it. The final squeeze chimney is secure if you can slip deep inside. I've heard that a number four big bro would fit here. Big people will find it easier to climb as an off-width on the outside, but that would be a damn scary way to lead it! There used to be a bolt but it has been pulled.

FFA: Andy Petefish, Tom Stubbs, & Jim Pearson did the first free ascent, 1977","""Far out!"" someone lightly etched into the sandstone on the second to last belay on Long Dong Wall. Although disturbing, it hit the nail on the head! This route is on the Kissing Couple formation just uphill from Independence Monument. Pitch 1. The route's crux - this pitch is in your face and makes a harsh warm-up! You climb a crack and some flakes straight up, while fishing small gear into the sandy crack. The crack goes to a finger crack then a hand crack. After this, you traverse left (crux) on thin holds to the chain anchor. Pitch 2. Climb the chimney system directly above the P1 anchors. Go up the chimney, past a couple 5.7 moves, and you access a bigger chimney. Bridge up the big chimney without any gear and only a little ledge for your feet at one spot for about 25 feet until you get to a roof. You can plug a #3.5 cam into a little pocket at the roof. Then squeeze between the roof and the wall to a mantwle. Clip the chains. Pitch 3. This is more of a scramble, but there is no pro. Move right from the anchors, and go up an easy chimney/ramp. You will see a few big slings around a rock pillar. Belay here. Pitch 4. There appears to be two different ways to start this pitch. Both of the cracks going up from the pillar converge after about 15 feet. We chose the right side which seems more correct. Either way, go up the slightly offwidth crack for about 20 or 30 vertical feet. Then you enter a really cool chimney. Chimney up between the ""long dong"", and the wall with no pro for about 20 or 30 more feet to a small, exposed ledge where you will see that somebody wrote ""Far Out!"". Clip a bolt, and belay from it. According to the guidebook, after the offwidth part, this is the best 5.8 pitch in the desert! It was really, very cool.... Pitch 5. You are now in ""The Belfry"". This is an exposed chimney/hole that goes all the way through the middle of the tower. There is overhanging pillars of rock going everywhere, and it is a little intimidating. You climb the face, sometimes stemming to the outside face, until the two sides converge at the very top. Do a little mantel move onto a ledge with chains, and belay. 5.10? for this pitch, mainly for the moves at the start, and the crazy exposure/committing moves. This pitch is really fun despite the fecal material which is located in parts of the belfry. From here, you can unclip and do an easy, short, chimneying boulder problem to the summit. Downclimb to the anchors, and get ready for the next crux...the descent/walk out. Descent: you need to bring two ropes on this route and hope to leave with them! You basically rap the route. This is how we did it, the book called for 4 raps. The first rap is done to the outside of the tower instead of down through the Belfry. Throw your ropes out to the wind, and rap down to the anchors at the top of pitch two...you will have to move around to this side during the rap. You will then have to pull like crazy to get the rope down. It is best to secure yourself with an anchor, and yank the rope from the ledge about 10 feet right of the anchor. Of course, you still hope that you get the rope back even if you are successful in pulling it! You might be better off going to the belay at top of pitch 3 in between raps, but it didn't look like it would help much, and the anchor at pitch 4 is just one bolt. You can rap all the way to the ground (above the boulder problem start) from the top of pitch 2. Make the long, uphill walk out...it isn't as bad as you think it will be.

Direct start : begin below a slab with a lone bolt that's visible where the wall turns vertical; the pitons on the regular start are more or less directly above. The slab is a little spicy but not too hard; the move by the bolt has been upgraded to 10b in the Levin guidebook, and I would concur, and it would be even harder if you're short. Above the bolt is some airy climbing with one thank-God placement before you merge with the regular route at the end of the traverse. Direct finish : instead of traversing above the pitons, you can continue ""straight up the crack at 5.10"", though this can be hard to initiate unless you step left first and then back right to the crack, and done that way the crack itself is easier than the move by the pitons. Either way, this variation is awesome and takes good pro once you engage the crack. (120 feet).

A beautiful, straight-up line with lots of good nutting and tricky clean aid. The original first two pitches are loose and not recommended. Pitches 1 and 2 follow Moonlight Buttress . Leave bags below the anchors of pitch 1 where the 5.10 variation goes. P1 (5.8) Start way left and scramble up 3rd class ledges and toss rope around bushes. Belayer needs to go up a few ledges (about 20 feet) so that 60 meter rope will reach anchors. P2 (5.10 or C1) Traverse right and throw overhang with small gear. Follow crack to anchors below large, closed-book corner. Don't haul on pitch 2, just drag haul line up P2 and P3 then easy haul from anchors on top of P3. P3 (5.10 or C1) Moonlight goes right, Lunar goes left up through large, flared chimney with a good crack in back. Good free climbing, much easier than aiding. P4 (5.9 C1) Can be done in two sections; not a bad idea due to rope drag. From ledge ascend obvious crack (5.9) to mantle, traverse right ~15-20 feet to bolt and beginning of C1 and the Halfmoon Traverse. If done in two sections can easily belay from nice ledge above mantle and haul all of pitch as one. P5 (C2) Begins the real meat of the route. Some fixed pieces to a Steep, thin crack. Hanging belay. P6 (C2) Pitch is called ""Leapfrogging Aliens"" and that's what you do. Steep, thin crack. Hanging belay. P7 (C2+) Same thing - steep, thin crack, this time broken by the Amoeba, a large mass of rock mysteriously clinging to rock face. The top of the pitch has dicey, sandy, mandatory 5.7 move to anchors. P8 (5.8 C1) From belay ledge carefully free climb (5.8) up sandy rock steps to crack. Possible to place small gear in horizontal crack. Easy C1 up crack takes you to huge ledge. P9 Two options: The original finish goes up right from multi-bolt anchor and has loose sections with mandatory free climbing. The Jarrett Finish (recommended) starts from the left side of the large ledge from the two bolt anchor. P9 Jarrett Variation (C1) Loose C1 at start to bomber, steep, and exposed C1 for bulk of route. Finishes at two bolt anchor at lip. Can back up bolts with extra lead line tied to tree. Bring bags and follower(s) up to two-bolt station first. Then, make easy work bringing pigs and people over lip. Bivy Huge ledge on top of Pitch 3 with 1 distanced pin, three equalized bolts, and one distanced bolt. Good for two portaledges. Good ledge on top of pitch 4 with three equalized bolts and additional bolt for portaledge. Best suited for one portaledge. Pitch 7 is okay bivy with three or four bolts and one pin. Easy to set up two ledges. Huge, monstrous ledge on top of pitch 8; two bolts on left side of ledge and multiple anchors on right (2 or 3 pins and 3 or 4 bolts). Great for multiple ledges. Ledge on top of pitch 3 could be slept on without portaledge, although uncomfortably. Pitch 8 would be a great sleeper ledge without portaledge. Topo","Offset aliens and nuts work great.

Desert Shield,https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105717934/desert-shield,5.11a,3.8,101,All Locations > Utah > Southwest Utah > Zion NP > Desert Shield Buttress,"Trad, Aid, 1000 ft (303 m), 9 pitches, Grade V","Drew Bedford, Tim Stack  April '94","Updated to reflect changes for 2024. This is an amazing route, combining both excellent free climbing and moderate clean aid on an amazing headwall. The anchors are all bolted, and you rap the route. Suggested you climb this on the weekdays, we saw 6 parties bail on route on the weekend, zero parties besides us on a Wednesday. “For competent and experienced parties there should be no problem doing this route in a day” If you are reading this description to find out how to climb the route, you should plan on two days. The aid climbing (I assume from experience on other routes and the placements) has gotten a bit trickier. The other IAD problem is how to get in there without an overnight pass and get back, since day users can’t get picked up by the shuttle, you have to wait for it to get in, there’s a big bivy BBQ ledge, etc. You need a permit to overnight, which now allows you access to drive your car up the road and park it. Avoid bikers and Turkeys. Approach- Walk up the trail to the vinyl brown steps, step over the right side. Go up and left to the angled handcrack (3rd class to base) P1 Continue over right to the base of a low angle crack (5.4ish). At the top, traverse hard left, then go up the blocky corner to an anchor. P2 Start on runout 5.7 face climbing to a sport-bolted section of 5.11a which is not really aidable (but you could always just pull on the bolts to make it easier). Instead of blowing out free climbing holds with hooks, just bring a 5’ stick clip/cheater stick or whatever. The bolted section sucks to aid with ladders, would suggest dogging the rope and just flailing on it. Appease the free climbing people and don’t use hooks. Up above it turns from fingers to hands/bigger hands. P3-We ended up linking this pitch to a comfy small stance, which is a handcrack at 5.9. There’s not really a separation between P2-3. Finish in an alcove with bolted anchor below a short #4 crack. P4 Go up #4 crack to base of chimney. A 5.9, left-facing chimney to some easier scrambling. There’s some death blocks in there. IF you don’t want to run it out on the outside of the squeeze, you need to lengthen your knot and take all the gear off your harness to squeeze in, and place 2’s-3’s above. Lower yourself out, then continue up to the BBQ ledge. P5 we climbed the face/cracks directly above BBQ ledge, a spooky move to a great edge, then blocky climbing. Then up to a somewhat sandy lieback flake crack system that ends to the left of the obvious prow (5.9). This seems like 100 ft or so. This is the white tat bolted anchor you can barely see in the red rock. P6 The business. Aid the bolt ladder with one hook move up the overhanging prow, around the corner, and then to a set of anchors at the base of the headwall crack. P7 The first pitch of the amazing crack that splits the headwall. C2+ micro-nutting fun; lots of aliens and offset aliens are good too. This pitch is fiddly and sustained, but never too hard as there is always a good cam or nut before a thin section. There’s a chance you could deck on the slab for a while, clip and bounce test everything. A #1 ballnut might work in a spot I used a #2 hand placed beak. Tons of different sizes and shapes of nuts. Fixed nuts seemed fine. P8 The second headwall pitch that begins easy, but packs a punch. Aid C2 for a while up to a bolt under an overlap. There are opportunities for Camalots throughout this section. Eventually it gets thinner and some hook moves and bathooks are necessary to move right to another crack. This is the C3 crux of the route. A couple more thin micro scars lead to mandatory 5.6 steep free climbing to the belay. This section is extremely loose. Beware of huge loose blocks, but it is possible to climb around them. P9 Didn't get to do this because of a huge thunderstorm that pummeled us and sent us to the ground in retreat. Apparently a C1 crack to a 5.6 ramp to a short bolt ladder to the top. Have great fun on this amazing route!","For the first half of the route (which is free) you'll want a standard free rack up to a number 4 Camalot. Take doubles in the hand-size pieces. Triples to #3 Camalot would make these pitches a lot more reasonable if you’re aiding any lower pitches or 5.9 is difficult for you. Aiding now requires 2 sets offset brassies, single wire DMM nuts, DMM offsets (4x #7 would not go unused) up to #11. 3 hooks, talons are not helpful. Two skyhooks, one cliff hanger. Offset cams are sometimes more useful than Totems on the aid pitches when you need them. 2-3 rivet hangers for summit pitch. #2-4 ballnuts, and 2-3 #2 beaks to be hand placed only. (This is likely controversial, but we firmly believe that a hand placed beak is just as clean as nuts, and possibly further enhances placements where you might actually be able to get a nut in it. Let’s be honest here, nut placements do not make the placement better afterwards. HOW TO NOT BLOW OUT THE ROCK FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS You want a proper nut tool to remove nuts, then use your ATC to tap-tap-tap up on the corner of the nut. It works. DO NOT JUST RIP NUTS straight up. This also messes up all your wires, and removes more of the placement than tapping them out.","Apr 21, 2024  ·  Lead / Fell/Hung. Lead p2, 4-5, 8. Amazing route.

Don't let this 2 star rating dissuade you - I'm keeping things in perspective. This route is as good as most of the ""3 star"" routes in the vicinity. P1. For the first pitch (10-), you need to be adept at crack climbing. It has a section of wide hands and fists. Also, this short pitch is rather polished, so watch your foot placements carefully. There are a couple of choices for establishing a belay at the end of the first pitch. Take the one that suits you best. We opted to stay low at the first large ledge to avoid the fumes of bird excrement. P2. Move up into what can best be described as a twin crack system. Take this upward and move right into a right-facing dihedral. This dihedral is mostly thin, but as I mentioned earlier, a #3.5 Friend (or 2) may have worked. I also managed a #1 Camalot, but a #2.5 Friend may have worked a little better. I got a wobbly, but decent nut at a weird block in the crack near the crux. Anyway, you will know when you get to the business. It looked like persons taller than myself may have moved slightly right at the crux. I pretty much had to go straight-up. My best advice for someone considering this climb is to 1) be able to crack climb; 2) have good footwork, including stemming; and 3) be comfortable doing cruxes a little above your gear. There is a 5.9 variation, where you stay left/straight above the first pitch. I only glanced at it and it looked good and may protect better than the 11- pitch. A couple parties that did it earlier and did the climb in one pitch. Erickson's book rated P1 5.9 and P2 10-!","Bring a standard rack at least up to a #4 Friend. A #4 Camalot was placed on the first pitch by my partner. I possibly could have used a #3.5 Friend on the mid/upper part of the 2nd pitch.

The line is not obvious from the ground, but it is not too difficult to discern once high on the cliff. The entire climb is easy, but entails many very runout traverses where serious falls could take place. The leader should be confident at the grade and so should the follower, as it is just as dangerous to follow this route as to lead it. Have fun, this route is very unique and I found the most enjoyable part to be finding tons of edges and huecos covering the entire route.

The route starts at the right side of the cave. Pitch one: climb up an easy ramp to the right margin of the overhang, which at this point is a blind corner. Place protection overhead in the curving roof/dihedral, and feel around the corner for the proper place to get established on the face (scary 5.8). An astute runout back to the left will be necessary to prevent horrendous rope drag.

Towering nearly 3000' this route offers 31 pitches of superb climbing right up the middle of the wall. Often referred to as the ""best rock climb in the world"" it is obvious why this route is one of the most sought after big walls in the valley and the world. Most of the pitches on this route are outstanding but with classics such as the ""Stovelegs"", ""King Swing"" and ""Great Roof"" you'll wish it would never end. Although this is a great climb the route is still very demanding, sustained and exposed and not to be taken lightly. Here are a few tips that might improve a parties chances of success and enjoyment on the route. First if you and or your partner(s) can lead 5.10 solidly this will greatly speed up the amount of time it takes to climb this route as a large percentage of the climb is 5.10 or easier. Second study the topo carefully because there are numerous opportunities to either link or use alternate belays in order to skip pitches (a team of three can also skip hauling certain pitches with some good planning). Unavoidable factors are the number of parties on the route and the weather, both of which can make the route not so classic.

Southwest Face,"Trad, Aid, 3500 ft (1061 m), 35 pitches, Grade VI","Royal Robbins, Tom Frost, Chuck Pratt 1961  FFA: Todd Skinner, Paul Piana, 1988","The Salathe Wall is an incredible route with lots of infamous wide cracks. The climb might be the longest route on El Cap at 35 pitches. There are many great ledges on this route, so consider leaving the portaledge at home. A common strategy is to either pre-haul to Heart Ledges, or rap once you get there and haul the next day. Four fixed lines bring you back to the ground. I wouldn't recommend hauling the free blast because it traverses a lot, is low angle, and will have the biggest crowds of the route. This climb breaks up nicely into several days worth of climbing. The first logical block is the Free Blast, which consists of the first 10 pitches of the route. Most of this can be free climbed for a 5.10 trad leader, and can be done fairly quickly. The climbing is low angle in comparison with the rest of the route, with a thrutch up the half dollar chimney on pitch 8. The free blast will leave you on top of Mammoth Terraces (where the Shield and Muir Wall diverge). From here, rap off the left side about 200 feet to Heart Ledges. From Heart, some non-obvious climbing leads up to Lung Ledge. Scramble up this ledge system until near its left end and set a belay. The next pitch is the hollow flake, with a pretty big pendulum required to gain the start of the flake. The lower part of this pitch can take a #6 camalot, but it can't be left because it gets too wide before you are above your pendulum point. The upper part of the hollow flake is extremely run out. This pitch ends up on the spacious hollow flake ledge (not a bad place for 2 people to sleep). From here, the route becomes a lot more plum, with a ton of traversing up to this point. A difficult chimney pitch right off of hollow flake ledge leads to two straight forward pitches. Above that is the other well known pitch of the route, the Ear. This pitch climbs into an overhanging bombay chimney. As you climb higher, it keeps getting narrower, until you have to chimney outwards and possibly remove your helmet. This pitch has good gear. Another pitch leads up to the Alcove, a great bivy ledge. From the back of the Alcove, a chimney leads to the coolest bivy spot ever, El Cap Spire. This spire is flat and airy, is big enough for a tent, and is detached on all sides. It is a big step across to gain the next crack system. Sleep here and enjoy it because the ledges are quite a bit worse above. A few more pitches of aid continue up, with a squeeze through a 5.9 chimney. This brings you to the base of the Sewer. This pitch almost always seeps water, and requires placing aliens in goo covered cracks. The end of this pitch is a hanging belay, so link it another short pitch length to the sloping but roomy ""Block"". This is an ok bivy, but you have to be creative. The climb tends diagonally up and left from here to a small ledge. the Sous Le Toit. A nice place to belay, but not a place to sleep. One long linked pitch gains the base of the roof below the headwall, where the climb gets exciting. Tackle the roof on mostly fixed gear, and continue up to a hanging belay. This jug is as airy as it gets. The headwall is split by a beautiful finger crack, which ends at Long Ledge. Long Ledge is the home stretch, and it is a very narrow ledge in a cool position. From the right side of the ledge, climb up for a few more pitches to the top. Free grade: 5.13b","This route amazingly has very little fixed gear. There aren't even fixed anchors in many spots. 2 sets of nuts, including small HB offsets.

At least two pitches (P11, P12) were removed entirely. Additionally, the bivy site used for this climb and the Upper Death Slabs approach are directly under the unstable zone and are subject to higher risk. For the most part, the first eleven pitches stay to the left of the rockfall line and the traverse on P12 heads across the top of the roofs that were a result of the rockfall. Traversing this close to the roofs can also be avoided by continuing higher before penduluming to the right. That said, you still wanna feel like a hero? Here's how. Get your gear and partner in order. Do an excruciating approach up thousands of feet, passing hundreds of knackered tourists from all over the world. Although a few will recognize you as a climber, most will look at you like you're a bit off in the head for shlepping an enormous, orange plastic backpack up the several million steps. And in many ways they're right, for you're about to pull off one of the most spectacular climbs on the face of our fair planet. After you get your ropes and anodized knick-knacks settled at the base and take your last pee, cast off! A sea of rock; steep corners and blank faces; evening light and morning shadow; torn hands and no water to spare. Ledges that are just a little too small; gravity-defying rodents scamper about your face/head/neck and chest in the dark hours of the night looking for a wee delicacy. At some point, you're near the top. They probably see you first, because They are always there, looking down, looking out. They exclaim in surprise and are honestly stunned. They cheer, and jeer, and all of a sudden you realize you're the center of attention like rarely ever in your life. You're a hero. Then you top out. Your partner jugs. You haul a bag that is, finally, light. And the questions come. Food and water are offered, and goddamn it, it tastes GOOD. The light is amazing. The view incredible...the elation is darn near making you float, and the reality of the brutal descent isn't even enough to dampen it a bit. Congratulations!--wasn't it worth it? Most of the climbing is very moderate--cruxes are short. Route finding is involved but not difficult, especially with a Supertopo. Difficulties are substantial but can be solved via smart thinking and tenacity. The Routefinding Crux --For me it was pitch 22. As the topo suggests, there is a smattering of bolts all over the darn thing. Trick is, it's hard to determine which bolts to use and which to forego. Seems as though folks have bolted different variations and knowing which bolt to pendulum to and which to pendulum from is a nit bit tricky. The Technical Crux--Color me stupid, but the 5.8 squeeze at the after the Thank God Ledge traverse is something that no man or woman should need to endure. The Psychological Crux--The aforementioned Thank God Ledge Traverse lives up to its billing. You won't forget it. Watch your rope drag, too. The Physical Crux--Let's just say it rhymes with ""falling"" and ""crawling"" and it sucks the life out of you even faster than it sucks out the energy. Go light, or suffer.","2 sets of nuts 2-3 sets of cams to a 3.5"". 1 4.5"" Aliens are great on this route, but not as valuable as they are on many other Yosemite walls (there are less flaring pin scars). There is fixed gear all over the place: ancient cams, stoppers, pins, and shiny bolts.

A few pitches of free climbing and easy aid make it a straight-forward, two-day climb for most teams. Bear in mind that this also makes this route the BUSIEST wall route in the entire Valley. The general approach is to climb to Dinner Ledge the first day, fix a couple of pitches from there, then head for the top on day two. P1) Climb up 5.8 corner (this is a RIGHT FACING corner, not left facing as the Sloan topo shows. Just left of the obvious straight-in splitter ""Jo Jo""), traverse out across the slab left of the corner and belay on a ledge at the top. P2) Go left across to the first nice corner and aid that to the anchor. There is a free-climbable (10b) corner left of that, but don't go too far or the climbing will get way hard and you'll have to penji back right to the anchors at the top. P3) Free climb up cracks and corners to the right end of Dinner Ledge. The good bivy spots are all out to the left below the Kor Roof. P4) Kor Roof pitch. Easy free climbing up a ramp takes you to bolts. Aid bolt-to-bolt up the roof to a crack that leads up and right. Aid this crack to belay anchors. MAKE SURE NOT TO BACK CLEAN TOO MUCH IN THIS CRACK OR YOUR SECOND WILL KILL YOU UPON ARRIVAL AT THE BELAY! P5) Crux pitch. Head up and over the small roof above the belay. A tricky move into the crack above, then continue aiding up the left along the arch. A short penji will get you to the anchor. P6) Continue aiding up and left, then up crack to anchor. P7) All time stopper pitch! Nuts are bomber here. Go straight up cracks to the anchor. P8) This pitch is free-climbable at 5.9. Climb up and cut right to chimney. Continue up to a belay in the chimney above. P9) Tricky pitch of mixed free climbing and aid goes out right and up from the chimney, then up some more to belay in a big tree. Nice!

Continue up the main corner, which appears wide and intimidating but can be adequately protected by smaller gear in the back of the crack. There is a small ledge halfway up this pitch, but you should continue up to the large, comfortable ledge at the end of the pitch. 165'. This pitch is very physical but very fun.

P3 - Continue up and slightly right on some cool flakes to a chimney/flare. The chimney looks hard from afar; but fear not, there are good hands in the back. Continue above on some easy face climbing to another short exposed bombay chimney formed by a big jutting flake, much like that of P2. Above this, at a bolt and a piton, make a wild, exposed traverse left to a great belay ledge with cool crystals on it. This traverse is not well protected for the leader nor the follower, but it is fairly secure with good holds, just very exposed. Make sure to extend pieces properly before the traverse to minimize rope drag around the corner. P4 - Straight off the ledge you can take the wide corner on the left, or some juggy face climbing to the right. The face climbing seemed easier to me and was very fun with some steep moves on great holds, but unprotected (beware expanding flakes).

Save small cams for the crux. Belay after turning the corner into a right-facing dihedral, or stretch the rope further to a better stance. P4: Continue traversing right and eventually end up on easy terrain leading to the descent. Alternatively, climb the excellent Jailbreak Finish, or reverse the entire traverse for more fun.

From the big sandy ledge, head up the corner past ample pro and set a belay about 160' up at the base of a huge oddly shaped cave. Sometimes referred to as 'The Belly'. From here an easier pitch leads up the remainder of the corner to a rap station tucked away under the headwall.

The rap is highly suggested if you are climbing with kids or not familiar with Tuolumne friction. RAP DESCENT: Rap from a station which can be found discreetly tucked up under the headwall.

P9 - (5.8) Up a finger crack, then continue more vertically through some challenging ground, avoiding Memorial Crack. I found this pitch more challenging than the first two. Finish on bolt anchors on the top of a boulder (same boulder that marks the end of Memorial Crack, but the LTNS anchors are climber's left. Several of these pitches could be logically linked, we linked P3 & P4 (too short for a 70m, we had to belay at a tree 5m below the anchors), P5 & P6, and P8 & P9. If I were to do it again I'd link P1 & P2, P4 and P5, P6 and P7, P8 & P9. More info here: squamishclimbingmagazine.ca… Rappel Descent: If rapping from pitch 9: R1: Climb over the belay rock to the ledge, walk to climbers right on the slab just outside the trees. There's a tree with a bunch of tat that works for a 70. (Not sure if it works for a 60, please update if you know. There's also a set of chains just over the edge that might be needed for a 60.) Rap puts you on Broadway ledge, a big ledge full of trees about level with and climber's right of memorial ledge. From here the walkoff is on climber's right and further rappels on climber's left. R2: Walk to climbers left through a bit of dirt to some chains. Rappel down to the same ledge as the end of P7. Instructions for the rest of the rappel below. If rapping from pitch 7 ledge (this would be raps 3-6 if coming from P9): R1: The rap anchors are further down the slab on climber's left, by two little trees. Large chain from bolts (15m) R2: Chain anchor station part way down the wall on a ledge (35m) R2.5: If have a 60, there is a single bolt with a locker to the right for the remaining 5m R3: Large chain anchor off tree (28m) R4: Bolted anchor (25m) Walkoff Descent: If coming from the pitch 9 ledge complete the first rap to get to Broadway ledge If coming from the pitch 7 ledge, scramble up & left via a fixed line to gain a prominent right-angling 4th class gully system. scramble up this (passing memorial ledge on your left) to its terminus, you're on Broadway ledge. On Broadway ledge, follow the well traveled path to the right till it peters out above some slab. Complete an exposed traverse trending slightly down with a jug rail for your hands and a short section of thin feet (those squeamish about exposure may want rock shoes on for this). A short remaining traverse/downclimb will put you above the top of Diedre.

It has is all: perfect rock, great setting, runout slab, stellar crack, strenuous laybacking, delicate face, and many variations. The first ascent was a 40 day epic, beautifully documented in the film ""In the Shadow of the Chief"" available from fringefilmworks.com/ It was finally freed at 5.13b in 2000 by Scott Cosgrove and Annie Overlin using a number of variations. You can get to the base of the Split Pillar by one of the routes listed in the Area description. Merci Me is described here: P1: From Flake Ledge climb the first pitch of Merci Me (5.7) past three bolts. The first is probably 30 or more feet out. P2: Merci Me continues up and slightly left into trickier terrain (5.8). Break right near the second bolt and go past a detached flake and then to a two bolt belay right where the wall becomes vertical. P3: Traverse right and slightly down, around the bulge (out of sight from your belayer) and into the 10b rising traverse. This traverse has good pro, but the feet are poor making it strenuous. Aid or boulder (5.12-) past three bolts to the base of the Split Pillar. P4: The Split Pillar is a highly photogenic crack comparable to an Indian Creek splitter. It's 10b to jam, but you would need the endurance of a 5.12 climber to layback it. The crack widens relentlessly from rattly fingers to wide fists over about 100ft. 30 more feet include some fun flake and squeeze chimney moves. The belay on top of the pillar is second to none. P5-6: The Sword is the technical crux of the route with an 11a crux early on. Place a few good pieces before committing to it. Pull out left onto the face above the crux and savour the exposure that might seem to have crept up on you. Easier climbing through a broken crack eventually forces you back into the dihedral on the right for a technical endurance finish to keep you honest. The belay here is in a spectacular position, but it's hanging and can be avoided by linking the bolt ladder above. Slings can serve as etriers for the 8 or 9 bolts in the ladder. P7: Perry's Layback is a fully bolted, lower angle pitch, which makes it sound like a walk, but many people debate whether it's the crux of route rather than The Sword. Climb efficiently... P8: The Flats: Several variations are possible here. The easiest, at 10a, goes right along a ledge until bolts lead up a slab to a ledge. A very reachy pull takes you to the belay ledge. P9: The final pitch is a very honest 10c requiring some tree climbing and then underclinging horizontally to the right around a big flake (The Sail Flake). Once the flake heads up and back left you're pretty much there. The climb can continue via the Roman Chimneys route, but most traverse off via Bellygood Ledge, a well-named 300 foot traverse to the right. Stay roped up. Descent: After traversing Bellygood, continue heading right into the forest. The trail should take you to a slab that you can descend hugging the vertical wall. A knotted rope will eventually take you to the well traveled backside trail which will take you to the climbers campground and finally the parking lot.","Merci Me is runout bolts (up to 5.8) with some small to medium cams and nuts possible near the end. The 10b traverse to the Split Pillar takes singles of small (finger size) to medium cams and nuts. The bolt ladders are manageable with improvised etriers and spare 'biners or draws. The Split Pillar is the gear hog on the route. A double set of cams from off-fingers to wide fists is normal. More if you're going to dog (and you'll if you layback), less if you're solid jamming from tight hands to big fists. Save a 1.5 inch piece for the last 15 feet. The final squeeze chimney can be protected via cracks in the back of it but you may not need it because, hey, it's a squeeze chimney. The Sword pitch takes mostly smaller nuts and cams up to tight hands. There are a few opportunities for slung horns and a 2 inch cam is optional. Perry Layback is closely bolted. The 10a pitch in The Flats is bolted but a small nut and a hand-size cam are handy. The final pitch takes finger to hand size cams. A few quick draws and cams are handy on the traverse off Bellygood Ledge.","Aug 5, 2023  ·  Lead / Fell/Hung. Hung following the sword and perry's"

The main feature itself took pretty much exclusively bomber #3 Camalots. I had two, and shuffled them up as I went. While it's surely a grunt, the nature of the flare is quite secure.

Its two pitches are themselves reasonably short, but it's often done as a single long pitch (probably not possible with a 50m rope, but 60 is fine). You can rap twice or bring a second rope and do one long rappel. The crux comes shortly after the first belay station and requires careful smearing while reaching between small but good finger locks.","Excellent the entire way.

The largest piece you could place would be a #1 camalot at the overlap, but there are many alternatives. There is one very old bolt near the top and then a good two bolt anchor with chains. NOTE: with a 70m rope you can get down, but you have to be careful to take advantage of the base sloping up to the left and rope stretch. With anything shorter, you'll need to use two ropes to get down. Alternatively, the leader can top belay (on a very nice ledge) and the second can bring up the second rope.

With the exception of Crap Crags, this is the easiest free route to breach the West Face of the Chief. That said, it is very sustained at 5.10, harder than Angels Crest but easier than the Grand. Sunset Strip utilizes sections of other climbs, Sticky Fingers, Millennium Falcon, Crap Crags, and The Gauntlet, with about 70% new terrain to create a very direct and interesting line up the Chief. The route has 12 pitches, several pitches can be linked and it is likely that many teams will repeat the route in 9 or 10 pitches. That said, the shorter pitches take advantage of good belay stances, decrease rope drag, and will reduce the size of rack required. The route is very well protected with several bolts added to the previously bold upper sections of The Gauntlet.

There are lots of ledges and terraces, and moving the belay is quite common. Begin on a blocky pitch of 5.8 with a pin. Climb up to a large ledge and belay. Climb the magnificent Angel's Crack, a diagonal hand and finger crack, at 5.10a. Belay on a good ledge at its end. Next, climb a difficult face, the crux, at 10b past 2 bolts and up into a corner. There is a belay at a large slung boulder on a slab, but I thought it was more comfortable to climb another 15 feet up and belay on the ledge above. Traverse along the ledge and up some easy slab to the base of the next wall (5.7). Face climb up to the beginning of a left-facing corner. Step right below this corner and enter a right-facing corner on the other side. This can be tricky to see from below. Climb up the corner (5.10a) and step right again below a roof. Belay on a ledge. Climb a pitch of 5.7 to a large ledge. This pitch can be successfully linked with the last one to make one long pitch. Move the belay to the base of the next wall. Climb up a ramp, step right to a second ramp, then step right again into a corner system (5.10a). Move the belay again. There are two options here. The normal way is to climb up a 5.9 lieback in a corner to another large ledge. The second is a 5.10b 7"" offwidth crack. This crack is pretty consistent in size, so you can't get a #5 Camalot in there, even way back (trust me on this one). Bring your Big Bros if you wanna shot at this beast. Follow the climber's trail up through the trees to the base of the Acrophobe's Traverse. Climb to the top of the first tower (5.7), rap off the back side, then scramble up low 5th class rock to a fixed rope (you can see it from the top of the rappel). Descend the fixed rope to a dirty alcove and climb up to the notch between the highest tower and the ridge (low 5th). From the notch, climb up to a nice ledge (5.9). You have a couple options from here. Start at a tree (using the tree to get past the start is permissable) and climb a 5.8+ fist crack up to a blocky corner. Continue up to the Whaleback Arete and belay at the base of the next, steep and somewhat intimidating, wall. Otherwise, traverse right along the ledge and climb a 5.10b/c crack, joining the route at the top of the Whaleback Arete. Begin this pitch at the large dead tree growing out of the crack. Pull through this opening roof past a pin using the main crack and also a second crack on the left. Continue jamming up steep ground, past several small roofs and a couple trees to the top of the wall (5.10a). This pitch is sustained and somewhat strenuous, so make sure you have some energy left! Step right into a 5.8 squeeze chimney, which opens up near the top. If you are carrying a pack, bring a double-length sling to drop the pack on, you won't be able to fit in the chimney otherwise. Congratulations! You are at the top! Enjoy the views from the Chief on the walk back, and then high-tail it down to the Howe Sound Brew Pub to celebrate!","A normal rack up to about 3"".

P1: 5.10b - From the anchor, tenuous face holds and side-pulling in shallow cracks brings you to an excellent hand crack. Follow the hand crack up into a mossy chimney that presents many options. A two-bolt anchor lies on the left side of the chimney on top of a small ledge. P2: 5.10a, 5.10c A0, or 5.11c, depending on how you go - The original route, with a single bolt for aid if you traverse right from the anchors. Pulling on a sling brings you to a crack system; these moves go free at 5.11c. The more common way is to continue up the chimney for about 20 feet then follow a crack on a ramp that goes down and right to a shallow corner. Done this way the pitch is overall 5.10a. Either way, from this point continue up a crack in a small corner until some large solid holds become available, then rightward and upward to a mantle onto a large ledge and the anchors. P3: From the anchors climb up the quartz-like face, past one bolt, to some cracks that will take gear. Hand and footholds are numerous but many are downsloping. Continue directly upward to the anchors, or bail out leftward into the pine trees. This pitch probably deserves an R rating. For descent, you may rappel the route with 2 60m ropes, use one of many rappel options to climber's left, or walk off easily. To find the trail, go leftward until you find the dirt road, follow it until you reach a steel and cable barricade, and go left.

A few blocky sections then lead to a perfect belay ledge. p3. This 5.9 pitch is awkward and strenuous, starting with a solid couple of layback moves into a flaring crack. After a few moves in the crack you can move onto the left wall and pass tough moves with good protection. Traverse far left under the roof and across a steep gully to a bolted belay. p4. The long crux pitch starts with an intimidating corner. Three small nuts can be placed to protect this corner -- take your time and place them well. The difficulty eases and then gradually ratchets back up as you work up a steepening corner to a 10a mantle crux. Climb ten more feet past the crux to a very cool belay. I've done this route twice a group of three and this belay is tight for two, but possible if no one minds getting cozy. p5. This pitch can be linked with the previous one. It's short but burly. Three cams (camalots 0.5, 1, and 2) are entirely sufficient for the entire pitch (so if you have just led p4 and have those pieces, keep going). p6.

Starts at the base of Snow Creek Wall and follows fantastic features up through the main shield to the top. This can be crowded, but it's a good place to chill and look at the view. Pretty easy to identify this route on the wall, because of the long, well-cleaned crack splitting the upper headwall. Follow that crack down to a ledge several bushes growing out of it. The regular start is the ledge/dihedral system about 80 feet right and 100 feet down from the end of that ledge. P1-P2 (5.7): An easy left-trending corner/scramble to a ledge. From the ledge, traverse past a fixed sling down and left to the huge ledge with the several bushes; you'll probably have to do a little easy simulclimbing to do this as one pitch. It is very easy to get lost at P1, be sure to pause at the near horizontal scramble, may require some downclimbing to a big ledge. There's also several fun variations starting further left that are a bit harder, but would allow you to pass a really slow party on the first pitch. Belay from the left side of the ledge at a sandy, flat ledge below a juggy crack system. P3 (5.9): From the ledge, either head up a steep crack with juggy flakes (some are a bit hollow) or start from the left up a dihedral. Either way, you end up at a roof. Step out to the right (this is airy and fun, with great pro) and follow the crack out right until it heads up again. Be careful of drag. Belay on a nice sloping ledge. (AS OF 8/8/2021 it is suspected that the key flake on this pitch has been torn off. Please use caution.) P4 (5.8). Head up and left on an easy slab peppered with knobs toward a right-facing dihedral. Get into the dihedral (crux of this pitch), top out, clip the bolt above the dihedral to help with rope drag, and traverse left to another ledge. Belay from the base of the splitter. Watch out for rope drag on this, too. Longer than it looks. P5 (5.7). The money pitch. Go up the obvious crack that splits the shield. One of the most enjoyable pitches in the world, I think. You'll giggle the whole way up. It's 130 feet long (?). You can jam in any of the bomber, perfect jams along the way, or if you get tired of that, step onto the stair-like knobs peppering the face. Sublime. And it ends on a perfect ledge with a separate crack to set an anchor. Gear wise might want to bring triples in hand size as its easy to run out of gear here P6 (5.9). Keep following the crack. A little ""bouldery"" crack move gets you off the ledge, then it's cruiser jamming to the top. A 70m rope will get you all the way to the summit boulder (takes small gear), but not to the trees 30 feet further up. Save small cams + nuts or, bring up your second before cruising up the low angle chickenheads. From here, there is a rap route (requires 2x 70m ropes), or scramble down the gullies on the left (as you're facing the wall). Follow the cairns all the way (well marked).

From the top of the face, follow the dihedral and subsequent crack systems up with good gear. Ascend until you are under the giant roof, then break right onto Saber ledge at the top of the crack system.

From Saber ledge, contemplate what lies ahead. The second pitch begins with instant exposure, and the airy step off Saber ledge may be the pyschological crux of the climb. Begin by traversing obvious holds leading left and slightly up from Saber ledge. Though intimidating, the traverse is easier than it looks, and giant holds await you on the arete. It is possible to protect the traverse with a reasonable small alien on the face, otherwise it may be possible to place large gear (with long slings!) above Saber ledge before beginning. Upon reaching the arete, climb past two bolts and follow your nose and your gear. P3.

He asked that I insert the following edits into the description regarding pitch one: 1. This pitch is mildly run-out at the grade, aka PG-13. 2. This pitch has been the site of numerous accidents, mainly due to climbers getting off route (climbing too far right) and/or falling at the runout sections. 3. The route finding on P1 is tricky. Look for the line of least resistance, which is generally straight up and NOT way out right. 4. This pitch is not a good first lead for climbers breaking into this grade, or for climbers new to Lumpy. Expect it to feel tough for 5.6. This is a great moderate climb to an exciting summit. It is the first lead for many Lumpy climbers.

It ascends one of the steepest and biggest cliffs in the state, offering great jamming and devious, exciting face sequences. Factor in the adventure factor and sublime setting, and...you just have to climb it for yourself! This is a detailed description replete with beta. If that bothers you, well, you know what to do.... [Edit: the current guide came out after this description was written and the pitches don't track precisely.] Temperature-wise, spring and fall are the best times to do the route. May and September are probably the most common months. April and October may offer better temps, but also shorter days and less stable weather. November through March is reserved for hardpersons, June is dubious, and summer is strictly for sundogs. The Scenic Cruise is actually a major 3 to 4-pitch variation to The Cruise , a route of 12 or so pitches that ascends the 1700' SE face of North Chasm View Wall. The Cruise was first ascended by Layton Kor and Larry Dalke in 1964, and christened the South Face. In the mid-'70s, Earl Wiggins and Jim Dunn free-climbed the route in 6 hours, and consequently re-named it "" The Cruise "". Three years later, Ed Webster and Joe Kaelin discovered the Scenic Cruise variation, thus avoiding a 5.10 offwidth pitch but adding spicy 5.10 face pitch. Amazingly, Wiggins then made the second ascent of the whole line with this variation-- in an hour and a half, free-solo! To find the start of the route, descend the Cruise Gully. After the second rappel, continue following the base of the rock, down past the 4th class trough area that leads to the large unmistakable gash of Ament's chimney. Left of that, hundreds of feet up, lie the huge right-facing corner of Kachina Wings and the large left-facing corner of the Journey Home. Further left is the diagonal crack system of the Dylan Wall, and the more or less vertical cracks of the Cruise and Scenic Cruise. The route begins a large, right-facing corner/groove, about 200 feet high, below the main crack systems. There is a flat rock and a bunch of poison ivy at or near the base. Above the corner is a low-angled, ledgy section; above that, the obvious diverging crack systems of The Cruise (left) and Scenic Cruise. Only a couple of the belays are fixed and there are a LOT of different ways to pitch it out. What follows is suggested for those who will be at or near their limit on this climb. 9 or 10 pitches is reasonable for a stronger team onsighting the route, and I've noted common pitch combinations. P1. Ascend the arete left of the corner, then step in and climb easily for a full ropelength to an uncomfortable belay. P2. Climb over a 5.8 roof and go up over broken grassy ground, past fixed slings to belay on the last ledge below a much steeper wall section. The Scenic Cruise splits from The Cruise here. We simul-climbed these pitches, as do a lot of parties. P3. Lead up and right over a 5.10- roof, and continue up the crack to a belay in a small inset. Or continue to belay on a ledge 50 feet higher...many do pitches ""3, 4, and 5"" as two long ones. P4. Exit the inset on the left and jam the continuous crack for 100 feet to a small stance with some fixed gear, fantastic 5.10-. P5. Jam the unrelenting but excellent hand and finger crack with many 5.10 sections, a harder version of the previous pitch. Considered the route crux by some. Belay in the pegmatite band. P6. This has the infamous Pegmatite Traverse, which rejoins the Cruise--a classic Black Canyon pitch. The easiest path moves up from the belay and then slightly left, avoiding the more prominent corner w/fixed pin directly above. Ascend a short 5.9+ crack in the pegmatite (3 friend helpful), then hand-traverse inobviously left on slopers, also 5.9. This achieves a stance on a down-slanting ramp. Reach back and sling a horn above the slopers: your best protection through the pitch's upcoming crux. An obvious flake/arete lies left of the ramp; climb that and continue up another crack to a fixed belay with slings around a block. A variation goes up into the corner/inset and traverses out and then down to the ramp at a fixed sling: reputedly harder, but easily aided with the sling. Either way, do not go all the way up to the top of the corner as this apparently leads to super sketchy shit. Also, note that the Williams guidebook erroneously describes this as a rightward traverse, although the topo has it correct. P7. Traverse 15 feet left and ascend a 5.10+ corner with sustained stemming and liebacking, some dubious rock, but adequate gear (generally considered the route crux). Make an awkward traverse right under a roof, and then ascend a hand crack in another corner. Above this continue up two sections of wider 5.8 (or belay, if out of gear and/or gas). The FFA apparently climbed a thin seam through pegmatite to the right of this. P8. The nice flat belay ledge has cracks leading up from either end, and both are climbable at about 5.8/9 with reasonable pro and quality (though the right has a nasty bush). Either way, above these continue up and left on easy ground and stretch the lead past a corner with several wedged blocks to a good ledge (or continue into the next pitch with a 70M rope, or brief simul-climbing). P9. Go left on the ledge and make an exposed move to get to an alcove behind a massive flake. Chimney up and right to a new bolt belay. Clever rope handling is necessary on this short pitch. P10. Follow a narrow, exposed ledge straight right, then angle up and right past three bolts with several insecure 5.9 moves. The last bolt is missing a hanger. Continue up and right through another pegmatite band to a nice belay ledge below a bulge leading into a groove. You can continue to the next ledge above the groove with a 60, although you'll face ledge-fall potential on the hard move into the groove. P11. Make an awkward 5.9+ move into the chimney, continue to a ledge, and head left for about 30 feet to the next crack system; belay where convenient. P12. Head up the crack/corner (with a fixed #3 Camalot) for a very long 5.9 pitch and arrange a belay. A variation which is often described as the standard line climbs gradually up and left from the ledge above the chimney on scary 5.9 face and flakes and rejoins the line. P13. Continue up the crack system, trending slightly right (5.8 or 5.9). Or, take an overhanging 5.9+ corner over to the left. Scramble to the top! The Black has a reputation for loose rock which is as a whole is well-deserved, but this route is pretty solid throughout, especially on the lower crack pitches. However, this is probably the most traveled route in the Black, so start early and wear a helmet! P.S. the Peg Traverse has been oversold in some places as a death pitch. It's definitely spicy but not too hard or runout. It is not as dangerous as P1 of Journey Home , to compare to another Black trade route.","The amount of gear can vary depending how hard you climb and how much you intend to link pitches. A good rack for a team at or near their limit will be nuts, a couple micro-cams, a double set of camming units from fingers to a #2 or 3 Camalot with a single (new) 4. Stronger leaders will not need the #4, but it does come in handy in a few places (unfortunately most of them are on the crux pitch).

Between the huge boulder leaning against the cliff to your right, and the largish block on your left make a couple of easier free moves onto the ledge atop the left block placing you below the thin splitter crack with the obvious pin scars. A yellow master cam can protect the opening moves, and a #5 or #6 BD Camalot can protect the move onto the ledge if you're so inclined. From the ledge follow the splitter crack into the right-facing corner above and then over the small roof above the corner. HB/DMM Alloy Offset nuts work like a dream in the pin scars. Once above the roof microcams mixed with nuts are the ticket (again, offsets work well) until you reach the belay anchor. P1 variation 5.4 C1 or 5.10, 25m. Stem and climb up onto the large boulder on the right. Take the crack that goes up from the right side of the boulder. This starts as .75 BD and eventually widens to 4 inches. There is a bit of looseness just before the ledge so be careful. P2 C2, 25m. From the belay anchor step left and follow the obvious scars up the shallow, left-facing corner. Cams mixed with nuts work well; A four-inch cam is useful a bit below the obvious bulge above, but the cam placement can't be seen from below. The bulge to the right of the triangular roof responds well to small nuts (offsets and Wild Country Superlight Rocks seem to be the ticket), and from there it's a mix of nuts and cams to the belay anchor. P3 C2, 30m. Head up the thin crack using small nuts for twenty feet or so, then a few larger nuts. The last 15 feet or so below the optional belay chains you'll be very happy to have doubles in red through blue tricams for use in the blown out pin scars. Without the tricams the placements will be somewhat nerve-wracking. Note that if you are so inclined, you could stretch P2 to the optional belay anchor; it'd probably help a bit with rope drag. From the optional belay anchor, head left and up to a fixed pin (a blue tricam is useful in a blown out scar before the pin). The first of two bolts is up and left from the pin. It's possible to do the required pendulum to the corner to the left from the first bolt, but it's a bit dicey so do yourself a favor and wait until the second bolt. Once in the corner purple-C4-size cams work well as the right-leaning crack gradually widens to green C4 size, and then red C4 size as it becomes horizontal for four or five feet. More red C4-size cams to get over the bulge and then up the lower-angled crack to the belay anchor (a last purple C4 is nice, and a few easy free/french free moves to the chains are possible if you're impatient). P4 C3, 30m. From the anchors step up and slightly right using a bolt to a stance, and some dicey placements (a tenuous-looking pink tricam with an even more tenuous-looking nut above works) lead to a narrow ledge atop a flake, below a sketchy-looking wedge bolt with most of the threads visible. If you aren't abnormally tall, a large Ibis hook placement on the ledge directly below the bolt allows you to step up and reach the bolt. From the bolt a small cam (yellow offset Mastercam or red alien) under the left of the roof leads to some offset nut placements up the left-facing corner. At the top of the corner under the roof are two bolts followed by a drilled angle. The moves out from under the roof onto the face to the right are strenuous, and figuring out how to make use of the boxed-out scars takes a bit of head-scratching (hint: orange Mastercam). Once on the face traverse slightly up and mostly right using fixed pins to a bolt below the belay anchor.

A few not-quite-confidence-inspiring nut placements in pin scars lead to a fixed pin, and from thence it's up and a bit right along the crack with nuts and microcams to a short, tight-hands-sized horizontal. From the horizontal it's up and right along a bolt ladder with two fixed pins. When the ladder ends a few easy free moves using boxed-out pin scars lead to the belay anchors. P6 3rd class C0. 20m.

It protects well the entire climb but the fact that you are climbing a giant detached flake becomes more obvious the higher you climb. The flake must weight many tons and is reasonbly solid but I suggest placing cams on the upper section in such a way that the outward force of a cam would exert a force on the flake pushing left/right of you as you face the rock (toward Static Cling) versus into/away from the rock (toward the road). It may be possible to push the flake outward but definitely not to the right toward Static Cling. This may not be possible in the wide section but is possible on the upper part of the route.

THE classic red rocks route. And it's just as good as everyone says it is. Approach as for the Black Velvet Wall. After climbing around the chockstone, return to the stream bed and walk another minute or two upstream. The bolts on the first pitch will be easily spotted on the left. This route has lost some of the original seriousness now that bolted anchors have been placed all the way up. This speeds things up considerably and provides an easy retreat if needed. You'll need two ropes if you intend to rap the route. The original description had 18 pitches. If you use the bolted belay anchors you can climb Epinephrine in 11 or 12 pitches. This description will assume that you use the bolted belays. It's hard to remember precisely how long (or how many!) pitches are on this route, but I'll do my best. Pitch 1: Climb out of the creekbed past bolts to a big ledge (5.8). Continue on past a couple more bolts to a bushy ledge. (165 feet, 5.8) Pitch 2: Work up and left into a chimney, then pull out the right side and work up easier rock to the base of the big chimney that forms the right side of the Black Tower.(165 feet?, 5.7). May need some rope stretch here. Pitch 3: The main event: chimney up a wide crack with good pro to a ledge on the right wall with bolts. (140', 5.9) Pitch 4: Chimney up and swing left as the crack narrows. Climb easier rock to a good ledge. Belay or continue on up into a narrower chimney with a fixed nut at the base and then two bolts. The bolts can be hard to spot - you need to work away from the back of the chimney to find them. If you have enough rope you can belay at the top of the Black Tower. Otherwise belay at the top of the chimney and do a short easy pitch to the tower's top. You can avoid the lower part of the chimney on the right. (165', 5.9) Pitch 5: Climb the face above the top of the tower, passing an overhang, aiming at a brushy ledge. (150', 5.8) Pitch 6: Traverse easily right to the Elephant's Trunk. Ascend this to a ledge at its top. (80', 5.6) Pitch 7: Climb up the crack system (some bolts) to a bolted belay at a ledge. (90', 5.8+) (can be combined with Pitch 6). The rap route goes straight down from here, avoiding pitches 5 and 6. Pitches 8 - 10: Continue up the same crack system, stopping at the bolted belays. A short traverse right (bolt) is found on pitch 10 before an easy roof (good gear, use jugs left of crack). (400', 5.8+) Pitch 11: Either rap the route or continue to the top of the crack. There is no rap anchor at the top of the pitch, though you'll see some bolts with missing hangers where there used to be an anchor. You can use a full 70m rope (and maybe some simul climbing) to get to the bolts at the top of the first 4th class section (see route exit below). Route exit: You've finished the 5th class climbing, but you're not done yet. There is about 600 feet of 4th class/5.2 slab that you need to climb. If you feel bold, you may choose to unrope and free-solo, or you and your partner can simulclimb the rest of the way up. Otherwise, you can build anchors and place a little gear as you go. Follow the right leaning ramp all the way to the very top. It ends just after turning into a very well defined right-facing dihedral, where you might find yourself mantling on the face behind you as you climb. If you are doing this part of the climb at night, you'll want to keep an eye out for an ""exit"" to the right, after passing through the dihedral section. You'll arrive at a large ledge at the top of the dihedral. If you try to keep going straight up, you'll encounter a 12 foot sandy/sometimes-wet ""wall"". Don't climb that wall. You'll step right 30 feet, and make a few moves to turn a corner. Keep in mind that for this entire ramp section, you'll not be able to see the famous pine tree or 4th class exit-pitch. Just keep trending up and right. Once you round the corner, you'll come to a very large sandy ledge protected by a roof. Proceed along the ledge, take the rightward facing ramp that's plainly visible ahead, and congratulate you and your partner for a job well done. Descent: follow cairns along the ridge leading east from the summit. There are a lot of cairns - if you miss them back track until you get back on the right trail. The route will eventually drop left towards Whiskey Peak at the top of Frogland. Logistics: Getting a pack through the chimney pitches is a pain - go light and bring a long sling to trail the pack when needed. The route gets almost no sun so you can go fairly light on water. Get an early start and move fast! Most of the climbing is 5.7 - 5.8. If you can avoid wasting time at the belays you should be able to get up in a day without too much effort. A competent party can easily get up in 8 hours. Figure on about 1 - 1.5 hours in descent. Don't leave gear at the base of the route if you choose to walk down - it's a long way out of the way to go back to the base. The last restroom is on the turnoff from the highway. Consider bringing a poop bag. In Jan 2021 a Nalgene full of poop exploded in the chimneys: https://www.mountainproject.com/forum/topic/120220349/epinephrine-conditions If the chimney pitches were in Yosemite they would be 5.7. This isn't the Steck-Salathe! 5.9 is consistent with other Las Vegas ratings though. Here's the step by step descent by Jon P (thanks!) 1. Head up to the summit of Black Velvet peak by rounding the big lone pine tree at the top of the route and scrambling which quickly eases into hiking. Enjoy the view of Las Vegas. 2. When looking out at Las Vegas from Black Velvet Peak, turn to face your 4:00 (right and slightly behind you), seeing another very large peak connected by a ridge and saddle. Follow this ridge, dropping down the saddle, and make your way up to the top of the large peak. 3. Once at the summit of the 2nd tall peak, look to your 8:00 (left and slightly behind) to see another ridge heading toward Hwy 160. 4. Scramble down the large peak to obtain this next ridge. Stay as high as safely possible as you follow the ridge which is sporadically marked with cairns. 5. Connect the dots along the ridge, hitting 3 or 4 more peaks as you follow the ridge. Only one of the peaks does not have a cairn on it but continue high on the ridge heading to the top of each peak. 6. You'll know when you are at the final peak because it has 4 or 5 very stout closely spaces cairns on it. It is obvious! If you are unsure then you are not there yet! 7. Once on top of the peak with the 4 or 5 big cairns, head left and down following the many cairns along the way. If you head down and do not see cairns, you are going the wrong way. 8. Get dumped into the Whisky Peak gully decent (turn right when you come to the fork) and continue down behind Frogland, following trails and cairns which are heading in the direction of Hwy 160. There are multiple trails going down this decent and they all seem to meet up eventually. 9. Upon exiting the gully, curve around whisky peak following the trail that curves left. 10. The decent trail back to the parking lot is several hundred feet before Frogland, marked with a large cairn sitting on top of a large boulder.","Set of cams from fingers to #4 with doubles in the 1-3"" range.

The climbing is not particularily appealing, but still fun. The pitches are not very distinct, and many belay spots are possible. Follow the prominent trail that starts at the Oak Creek Canyon parking lot for 45 minutes to an hour or so to get to a huge gully on the right. P1) Pick a route up the gully. Many possiblities exist. A wide crack is in the middle of the face, or a smaller crack to the right. Step around left eventually to a fixed anchor. (5.1) P2) Scramble and chimney up the left side of the gully. When the gully opens up, a belay is possible at an oak tree with slings to the right. Another option is to continue until a wide steeper section is encountered. (4th class) P3) Climb up this water worn area passing a sling-threaded hole. This is a possible belay, but it is best to continue on. Belay when comfortable. (5.1) P4) Scramble up to a vertical wide chimney that is often wet. Belay. (4th class) P5) Climb the chimney. A set of anchors is immediately at the top left of the chimney, or continue higher to the main terrace. (5.3) Descent: Rappel the route. Fixed anchors can be found in many places. 5 rappels are necessary and some easy down climbing. Make sure to make mental notes as to where the anchors are at in case of a rappel in the dark after Solar Slab. With two ropes, it's possible to reduce the number of rappel pitches by starting at the top of Jonny Vegas and descending into Solar Slab Gully.

The route is long, but much of the climbing is easy and a fair bit of it is mediocre. Two stars is generous, but it makes for a pretty fun adventure with a little bit of challenging route-finding and more commitment (due to the wnadering line and lack of fixed anchors) than many long routes in Red Rocks. Hike past the main face of Solar Slab into the main Oak Creek drainage, continuing until the large and complex wall in the photo below appears. Leave your stuff below 600' of slabs, and scramble up to a long left-facing corner approximately in the middle of the wall, and left of a large flatiron feature. Locate the large RF corner on the upper left portion of the wall; the final 4 pitches follow this corner, and the route starts quite a ways to the right of it before wandering up and over. Pitches one and two are long 5.8 leads up the corner (bypass the bolted anchors in order to stretch these leads). P3 is easier and wanders left and then back right at about 5.5. P4 is very easy fifth class and over 300 feet long; basically, simul-climb while finding the easiest path up and left to the main corner system on the upper wall. Belay in a comfy alcove down and right of a clean V-slot corner. P5 is the jewel of the route: do exciting face moves up and left past a bolt into the corner, and climb for 150 wonderful feet, passing a cool chimney en route to a good belay ledge below 2 bolts. P6 climbs past the bolts with a cool, tricky 5.9+ move (upgraded to 10a in Supertopo). Continue up the cracks above which are are really good. Several belays are possible. P7 continues up the huge corner with stiff for 5.7 liebacking past a bolt. Where the corner arcs right, traverse the face straight right to a fixed belay. P8 is one of the wilder 5.5 pitches I've done. Follow a few bolts right and then up on runout, loose, exposed but awesome face climbing. Cut back left through the main corner into a groove that leads to the top. The descent is fairly involved. We scrambled up to the next ledge (well short of the buttress top), then followed this left (west) and down a ramp with a line of cairns to a new bolted rappel station. You have to downclimb an easy chimney to get to the station. Two double-rope raps got us to a large bowl, which we followed down and skiers' right to a terrace with a large boulder. From here, take the ramp west into the Oak Creek drainage and follow that back to your packs. You can do three raps with a single 60m rope (using a mid station after the first one), but the last one WILL NOT REACH GROUND. With a lot of stretch and a big swing to the left, you can barely reach a 4th class ramp and get off. But you'll probably die. Not recommended. Another rappel route from the top of the buttress uses several single rope raps to get into the bowl. It may also be possible to traverse across the top of Solar Slab and descend the gully east of that route.

It has been a popular route for a long time and is quite historic. To reach the bottom of the climb, hike around to the North side of the Matron and follow a climber's trail up until you reach a large block. Chimney up between this block and the Matron and start on the bench immediately afterwards. The climb is roughly four pitches long - about 1.5 pitches of steep 5.6 on the North Face, and then easy scrambling to the summit on the East Ridge. P1: follow a left-leaning crack on the face past a few old rusty pins to a ledge with a small tree (5.6). P2: climb the short crack out onto the East Face, and belay on a ledge wherever convenient (5.6). From here, the climb is much like scrambling on the East Faces of any Flatiron and is easy, well-featured, and offers little pro. Scramble for a couple hundred feet of 5.2-5.4 to the summit.","A light rack is sufficient. Bring maybe 1 set of nuts and a small hanful of cams as well as a few quickdraws for the fixed pins.

In other words, a 5.7s Flatiron and Eldo climb are very different in nature. You won't notice a 80ft. runout on the Third like you would on a climb like Icarus (5.6s) in Eldo. With that said, be wary, but not scared off by the serious fall potential rating. Start from the East Bench and move straight up. You may also move to the L and belay at a small tree on the edge of the channel. After three pitches, you can either move R of the ""U"", (7s) or through the middle (6s). After this fork, two more pitches will gain the summit. DESCENT: There are three rappels from fixed eye-bolts. A single 50m rope is sufficient; on the last rappel, you may either use a double-rope for the 140ft. mostly free-rappel or traverse [left] on a ledge and rap 72ft. on a single rope to the West Bench.",Standard rack on the light side.,"Dec 26, 2022  ·  Solo."

The easier route up the face follows the right side of the crack sometimes wandering as far as 10-20 feet to the right. Climbing the left side is 5.6. Climb past a bulge and set up a belay at a tree in the crack. P2: Continue up the right side of the crack (now protectable). Overcome another bulge and continue P3 to the top on now much easier terrain. Once you reach the summit of the East Piece downclimb South West for 100 feet and rappel 50 feet Southwest from a tree, down to the slabs of the second piece of the Fatiron. The Western piece of the Fatiron is much easier, we chose to simulclimb it. Climb the center of the face and wander left after reaching a huge ledge.

From the low point of the Maiden, hike up along the base of the south face. Drop your packs below the obvious Crow's Nest below the West Overhang, and pick your way through the huge boulders to the top (west end) of the crag. Climb the initial west-facing wall to a belay at the top about 40 feet up. There is little or no protection on this lead, and the difficulty is around 5.4. At this point, the summit of the Maiden will be due east, and actually right about the same height that you are at. From here, downclimb the slab to the Crow's Nest. This is essentially a typical Flatiron slab with sometimes minimal protection. The leader will be on toprope, but the second may appreciate some pro. From the first belay, the angles look very strange, and it is difficult to tell how steep things are. Belay from the bolt at the Crow's Nest. The next two pitches are tricky. I downclimbed the North Face a little bit and worked east. Once I was below the obvious tree, I climbed through bulging wall which is the crux. This was all done with basically no pro, but try to protect your second on the downclimb and traverse. Per Japhy Dhungana : a hand-sized cam protects the hardest moves. Belay on the ledge at a 2 bolt anchor next to the tree. This anchor was installed during the first ascent of North Side of the Sky , and was established to 1) protect the tree, and 2) to provide an alternative descent to the North from the summit of the Maiden. From here, climb up past the tree and a short corner to another ledge, and follow the wildly exposed ramp east and down until an obvious weakness allows you to hop up to a belay niche. Rope drag can be amazing on this pitch. From here, hop up onto the east face, and head for the surprisingly large summit area. Rap to the Crow's Nest (!!!) and then down the south face to your packs....",Bring a standard rack of nuts and cams. Long runners are helpful.

Footholds are the key on this one, and if they cut, you're out of luck. A cruxy pull or two midway up the arete leads to good holds and the top. This is a worthy and extremely fun line.

The route is most easily recognized by the left-leaning offwidth crack about 15' off the deck. P1: There are two ways to start. On the right is a left-facing corner leading up to a small roof - you traverse left under the roof to the offwidth crack (5.7 and reasonably protected). A more direct start traverses on thin holds (no protection) to the rib below the offwidth crack and then up. This is 5.7 and scary, but a good spot will keep you safe. In either case, attack the offwidth above. At a horizontal you can either traverse right out of the crack and climb the face or be like Fritz and power up the offwidth. Both of these are about 5.7.

The first pitch is also the start of a climb called ""The Big Horn."" Starts on a ledge with a single scrub oak. Pitch 1: Climb the obvious crack which shoots up to the big ledge. Continue up the well-protected varnished crack/face with lots of features for hands and feet. This pitch loves nuts! Climb straight up to the big ledge with a scrub oak. Bolted anchors. 5.6. Pitch 2: Stay right of the chimney (the chimney to the left of the anchors is the start of pitch 2 of The Big Horn.) Start on the face above the anchors. Climb up to a left-facing corner. There are a couple of little offwidth moves in this section. Stay right at the top of the chimney, stepping out of the alcove, then move left into the crack, climbing up to a ledge with loose rock and bolted anchors. 5.7. Pitch 3: Climb up about 10 feet and look to your left, for a left-leaning, right-facing corner/ramp. Follow the fun, narrow ramp, continuing to traverse left, to a protection bolt. The pro is a little tricky before the bolt: nuts in not too obvious seams. Move a little left of the bolt, then go straight up to the thin right-facing corner and up right to a ledge with bolted anchors. 5.7+. Pitch 4: Climb up and traverse right about 20-30 feet heading for black varnished face holds. Climb up the black varnished face, following the path of least resistance, to a belay at a small stance. The P4 belay can not be seen until about 15 feet from it. A good amount of gear can be had on this pitch. 5.6. Note: Don't go straight up from the belay; the climbing peters out into unprotectable face climbing on less than inspiring white/orange rock. Pitch 5: From the belay look up and right 60 feet or more for a light brown 2-3 ft roof (about 20-30 feet to the right of the belay). Birdland goes just left of the edge of that roof and up the nice crack that is above the roof and out of sight.

The climb is 9 pitches long and over 1200 feet in height. However, the start of Solar Slab is on a huge terrace 500 feet up, which has a few different multi-pitch approaches. Probably the most common ways to get to the base of Solar Slab are to climb Johnny Vegas (5.7, 4 pitches), or the Solar Slab Gully (5.3, 5 pitches). An early start is highly recommended to beat the crowds, climb the 14 pitches, and make the lengthy descent. A headlamp is also a good idea. Start from the Oak Creek Canyon parking area, and follow the obvious trail for 45 minutes to an hour. A prominent trail leads to an obvious gully to the right, the Solar Slab Gully. Climb this or Johnny Vegas to the terrace 500 feet up. P1) Wander up the beautiful featured golden slab for quite a ways to the start of a nice hand crack. There is little pro in the slab, and the hardest move is gaining the crack system. Follow the crack system to a ledge with a fixed 2-bolt anchor. (5.5) P2) From the ledge, follow the sandy chimney left and up to another ledge to belay at. This is probably the worst pitch of the climb. (5.5) P3) Wander up unprotected but well featured rock for about 20 feet to a finger crack. Traverse right when obvious and follow a corner to a small belay ledge. (5.6) P4) Climb a varnished left facing corner until possible to traverse right to a huge belay ledge with fixed anchors. (5.6) P5) Climb the beautiful hand crack as long as desired, eventually sinking in a belay at the best spot possible. Some bolts are found near the crack on this pitch. This is a 3 star pitch. (5.5) P6) Finish up this crack, stepping left eventually and belaying at the top of a pillar. I don't recommend trying to link this pitch with P5. I don't think that even a 60 meter rope is long enough. (5.4) P7) Wander up and right protecting in various features to get to a low angle crack. Climb this crack up to an anchor. Don't stop at this point, but remember where this anchor is if you are planning to rap the route. Instead, traverse right a bit, then go up and easy corner to the huge low angle terrace. (5.3) P8) Scramble up to a black varnished dihedral and sink a belay. Depending on your comfort level, this pitch can be done unroped. (class 4) P9) Climb the black dihedral until the angle kicks back and sink a belay. (5.5) Descent: Rappelling down slab is recommended unless many parties are below you. There is a good chance of getting your rop caught, so it is recommended to saddle it while lowering. There is a way to walk off back but it is difficult and time consuming. The rappels also take a lot of time, but it is a fairly straight forward way of getting off the rock. Down climb to the right of the last pitch on easy slabs (3rd class) to get to a traverse around to the belay ledge used below the dihedral. Then downclimb the 8th pitch and the last easy part of pitch 7 until the anchors mentioned. From here, rap (double ropes, 200' better, maybe even necessary?). Probably about 6 rappels gets you to the starting terrace. Then rap either Johnny Vegas or Solar Slab Gully (another 5 rappels).

For many years I avoided the route because it always seemed mobbed. Then, on a day when the wind was screaming down the canyon we figured nobody would be on it. Wrong! Another party at the base. We still had a fun time and everyone was very friendly and nobody was in a rush. Good to adopt this attitude on this route - if it's high season it's going to be crowded. This route faces south and can get quite hot. It can be done on a sunny winter day and you could die of heat stroke in the summer. Hike the trail to where the two forks of Pine Creek join at the base of Mescalito. Here you want to take the left (south) fork. Follow a trail on the north bank past a prominent buttress, then curve right up a broad, bushy gully to the base of the route. The first pitch faces southwest and is in the shade in early morning, it cannot be seen from the parking lot. P1&2: Follow a 5.6 crack up and left (4"" piece can be useful at one point if you want really good pro). At 110' you hit a 2 bolt anchor, but you can continue to the next anchor (60m rope better for this). The next bolted anchor is off to the right on a ledge, we missed it on the way up. It is easy to get sucked left into a gully, where you can just belay from gear. [Many parties still split this long pitch into two] This next part is not well described in Swain: wander up and right on a huge terrace to the highest point on the ledge. This is 3rd class except for maybe the first move, and we downclimbed it unroped on the way down, but many people choose to stay roped up for it. P3: You are aiming for a tree at the top of a gully, make a weird boulder problem off the deck and then continue more easily up the gully to the tree, 5.5, 70'. P4: The wall steepens. Climb a thin crack in a black face and step left below a roof. Follow another crack all the way up to a block slung with slings, 5.6, 150'. P5: Above here you see some bolts, this is the 10d direct variation, go for it if you want! The normal finish is to go down from the belay and traverse right around the corner. Keep traversing until you are to the base of a beautiful crack in the center of a black wall, 5.3 50'. P6: Climb the crack, angle right to a bolt, and then up a face (somewhat runout) to a 2 bolt belay, 5.6 100'. We combined P5 and P6 with a 50m rope but this makes the final runout moves of P6 harder with all the rope drag. You can continue to the summit of Mescalito from here (many pitches mostly 3rd and 4th with some 5th class), but virtually all rap: First 130' to the top of pitch 4 (lots of rope drag to pull, plus knobs to catch the rope, some recommend doing this as a 50' rap to an intermediate bolted anchor and then an 80' rap to the top of pitch 4). Second rappel 140' from the big block to the tree at the top of pitch 3. Third rappel 70' from the tree to the big ledge. Scramble down the ledge to the bolts at the top of the second pitch (this down scramble is a little tricky at the end, watch out, maybe belay beginners). Fourth rappel 150' from the bolts at the top of the second pitch, angling left (north) to make the ground. We experienced bad rope drag pulling this one too and perhaps it is better to do use the bolts atop pitch 1 to split it up into two.

Continue up another short chimney to a belay at yet another big ledge (gear anchor). 5.6, 140'. P2 - head up the obvious crack system. It is weird and is more or less a double crack system. After ~20', the left crack goes up past a bolt and continues as Black Sun . The right crack is the original line; however, you could continue up Black Sun a bit further and angle right later. You'll figure-out how to do it. Double #4 Camalots and a bit of leap-frogging can make this more reasonable. Note, face climb around some large, loose blocks in the last 25' of this pitch. Be very careful with these, they shift. This pitch also takes a couple of bomber medium to large stoppers towards the top. At the end of this pitch, you will be placed at a ledge with a bolted belay. Oh yeah, it's honest 5.8, 100'. P3 - this is the business (true 5.9). Most of it is wide, but most of the protection is not. All I can say is don't get tunnel vision at the crux, which has the 3rd bolt near it. If you are a runt like me, you can squeeze into the chimney after the crux and feel secure. If not, there are face climbing options on polished calcite. There are protection options deep in the chimney.

It can be blazing hot in the quiet sun to unpredictably cold in the shade and wind, so be prepared. This route can be incredibly popular with even foreigners queuing up. Fortunately, you can descend from most points quite easily. It is of the utmost importance that you bring a gym/sport climber with you to follow you on this routes, especially if they are European. Doing this will make this route an even more memorable experience. Trust me. Additionally, do the route in the winter. You can get 1/2 price motel rooms in Moab and the crowds won't be there. Note: You can and should back-up every belay. Also, there is calcite all up and down this route. I hate calcite - except for one place where you agree with me.","A standard rack will work fine on this route to #4 Camalot; however, doubles may feel a bit heavy for 5.10 climbers.

There are three new bolts on the crux pitch, so don't despair. Bring 2 ropes to rappel. Finally, two shoulder gear slings for the leader and belayer will be vastly more appreciated than having gear dangling off your harnesses. In contrast to many desert routes, this climb utilizes calcite-coated Wingate sandstone for much of the route.

Ribbon Falls Amphi…,"Trad, Aid, 1000 ft (303 m), 8 pitches, Grade IV",Layton Kor (of Gold Wall). FA of Silent Line: Werner Braun and Rick Cashner. FFA of Silent Line: Dean Potter.,"The Silent Line is the free version of the Gold Wall. It has been freed in its entirety by Dean Potter at 5.13a, but since 99% of folks (myself included) will aid the crux, I've posted it here as 5.10 C1. Once you've arrived at the base of the wall (see area description), look for a flake system with a slung horn about 25' up. Up and left of the slung horn, you'll see a line of bolts leading to a splitter crack system. This is the route. There is another partially bolted route in the vicinity, about 100' right of Gold Wall/Silent Line. This follows a splitter crack to a bolted arete to bolted anchor. I haven't done this pitch, but include it here as a reference point. P1: Climb up flakes, past the slung horn/hole, and then traverse left to the bolt line. Climb the bolt ladder directly (A0), and then make some thin aid or free moves (5.11 or C1). I believe the free line clips the first bolt and then traverses right on some cool looking knobs. Looks difficult and bold. Either way, end at a 2 bolt anchor, 90'. P2: A burly pitch, definitely the crux of the route if you're climbing at 5.10 C1. Difficult moves up a flaring crack with pins scars greet you just off the belay (5.11 or C1), and then an unrelenting flared groove provides insecure free climbing or awkward aid. Big cams (#4 camalots) might be nice if aiding. Ends at 2 bolts, 120'. P1 and 2 Link with a 70m rope, and it's probably a good idea if you want to free the 5.11 at the start of the pitch, other wise you'd be whipping onto you're belayer. P3. Climb straight up, pass right around a chockstone with a tree at the top, and continue up a flaring fist crack. Keep an eye out left, because you're going to leave the main crack system here and traverse left on face holds to a small RF corner. The 2 bolt anchor for ""Gold Wall"" will be above you, and the 2 bolt anchor for Silent Line is visible to the left. Make the fun traverse left (5.10), and gain the flared crack, following it to the anchor. 90' P4: The Money Pitch! More tricky groove climbing above the anchor gives way to a beautiful splitter, starting as fingers, passing a large tree (optional belay) and widening to fists. Its mostly glorious hands, though, so enjoy it! 200', 5.10. P5: Another wild and enjoyable pitch! Go up a flared hand crack and enter the maw above, a huge triangular chimney leading into the massive roof. Enter the dark recesses of the chimney, and when all appears to be lost, an exit appears! Slither out a slot, and pull up into a hand crack. Revel in the exposure, be amazed at how somehow you're rope doesn't get stuck (backcleaning gear in the final handcrack is advised), and enjoys this totally unique pitch! 2 bolt anchor, 90', 5.9. P6: Up flaring hands, fists, OW and chimneys. Very fun, although you might be getting tired of handcracks. 2 Bolts, 90', 5.10. P7: More of the same, 5.9, 110', to a small ledge with a tree and a fixed stopper anchor. P6 and 7 link with a 70m cord. P8: Traverse left off up a groove, past some big flakes, and into a huge flake/chimney system. At the top of the chimney, the angles lessens as you scramble up easier grooves. When you get to the ledge with trees, traverse right to a slung tree anchors, and enjoy the spectacular view of Ribbon Falls. Even though you could hear it the whole time, and occasionally felt some spray in the air, the falls have been hidden for the entire route until now! This is where we stopped, and I think most people will as well, especially if they plan to rap the route. If you want to continue, it looks like dirty, low-angle climbing. Descent: We rapped the route. Supertopo mentions that there is another descent option if you want to top out, involving walking west and rapping a gully. Sorry I don't have more info. To rap the route, you'll need 2 ropes, or a 70m and some shenanigans for the top rap. First the beta for 2 ropes: Rap from the tree atop P8, straight down to the fixed stopper anchor atop P7, 140'. Continue down the route, entirely on nice new ASCA bolted anchors. Passing the huge roof, you'll use 2 stations on Gold Wall, since Silent Line is too far left. Beta for a single 70m rope: From P7 down, you're fine with a 70m, although be careful on P2, we had a skinny, stretchy rope and barely made it. If you rapped from P7, you wouldn't be missing too much climbing-wise, just a 5.9 chimney, but you would be missing the awesome view of Ribbon Falls. It is possible to rap from P8 with a 70m if you traverse hard left, back into the chimneys you just climbed, and get to a slung chockstone. One rap from here gets you back to the fixed stopped anchor atop P7.","You're rack depends on how much you plan on aiding. A party comfortably climbing Yosemite 5.11 can get by with a single rack to #3 Camalot, with doubles #0.4 to #2.

Sentinel Rock,"Trad, 15 pitches",Allen Steck & John Salathe - 1950,"The Steck-Salathe truly deserves its status as one of the ""Fifty Classic Climbs of North America"". Everything from the climbing itself to the many stories of adventure had on the north face of the Sentinel makes this climb a must-do for any aspiring Valley climber -- if not a route to be repeated again and again, it certainly should at least be seen as a rite of passage. The climb's reputation for being long, wide, and physical is well deserved, but the quality of that climbing, the position one achieves, and the overall sense of adventure the route offers should not be understated. On the first ascent in 1950 Allen Steck and John Salathe reached the top of the Flying Buttress (the first half of the route) in two days, and took another three to reach the summit (Royal Robbins made the second and third ascents a few years later). Today the route is commonly done by free-soloists in the lesser part of a morning; but this is also the climb that nearly resulted in the deaths of Dean Potter and Timmy O'Neill (a fantastic account of their antics appeared in one of the climbing mags a few years back), and did take the life of beloved Derek Hersey. Most parties should expect a very full day even with a first light start, but fast parties could certainly make it down for dinner if they move efficiently and link pitches. Originally rated 5.9, the route has been upgraded to 5.10b which is much more like it. Nevertheless, the 5.10 sections aren't too bad -- it's all those 5.8 and 5.9 wide pitches that present the true crux of the route. There are many ways to pitch out this climb; this description describes my experience on it. Approach by parking at the Four Mile Trailhead. Follow this trail for a long half-mile to a point on the trail where a narrow, tree-shrouded talus slope heads up into the woods. This is sometimes marked by a cairn, but it is fairly easy to find: if in doubt, continue east on the main trail for a minute or two to an obvious stream bed (sometimes dry late in the season) and then backtrack 100-200 feet to the talus. Head up a well-defined climber's trail in the talus until it eventually dead-ends at the base of the Sentinel at a steep, wide, west-trending ramp. This is a convenient place to rack up and stash the packs. Follow this ramp up until it eventually turns into a narrow system of catwalk-like ledges that weave back and forth up the north face of the Sentinel. This amazing passage (reminiscent of the approach to Hobbit Book in Tuolumne) gains about 1/3 of the height of the Sentinel via simple 3rd and 4th class scrambling. It's hard to get lost on this ramp system, and eventually it opens up to a small, loose area near the western edge of the face. Continue scrambling up until you reach the base of a significant right-facing corner with, yes, a wide crack. This is the start of the route -- you can't scramble any higher. P1: A 60' right-facing corner with a wide crack in it. This can be negotiated with squeezing and OW skills, but I found it easier to lieback. 5.8, strenuous. I was glad to have a #4.5 Camalot (#5 C4). This leads to a belay stance which I skipped. Step right and continue up some 5.8 cracks to another stance and belay -- a long pitch. P2: Climb a touch more 5.8 past some fixed gear, then easier terrain, then a brief finger crack, then wandering climbing up a gully system to some final wide cracks and a belay below the base of the Wilson Overhang. Another long pitch, 5.8. P3: The Wilson Overhang. Climb up an ever-steepening chimney/corner system with a difficult to reach hand crack in the back. Eventually one must commit to either jamming and squeezing awkwardly or stemming out a ways with little pro. There are good face holds for doing the latter. Pull the overhang and climb easier ground up to a belay on a pedestal. This pitch is accurately rated 5.10a but is not the crux of the climb. P4: Climb up an absolutely horrendous 5.9 squeeze and then traverse right and up to a belay at the base of a huge gully/chute system. Alternatively (highly recommended), skip the squeeze in favor of an unprotected 5.8 flake out right. The squeeze may very well be the crux of the route -- UGH. P5 & P6: Climb one of many crack systems for the next two pitches up the gully/chute until it is possible to tunnel through the tip of the Flying Buttress to the left. This is a good area to simulclimb or pass other parties as there are many avenues. 5.8-5.10 depending on how you go. Belay at a rap station on the east side of the Flying Buttress -- this is the halfway point and after this retreat becomes more difficult. Do a short (40') rap off the anchor to another anchor at the base of a steep crack system. I guess you can also downclimb this section? Looked difficult. P7: Ascend the steep and difficult crack system up to an obvious belay -- this is an interesting and challenging pitch. 5.9. P8: Face climb up and right, then wander sharply back left and up to a belay below a long corner/slot that leads up into The Narrows. There are several fixed pieces protecting this pitch, but small/medium wires work well too. 5.9 and a somewhat heady change of pace from all the thrutching thus far. Don't worry -- its all thrutching the rest of the way from here. P9: This corner to flare to chimney is rated 5.10b which would lead one to believe its the crux of the climb, but it goes quite well, especially if you're willing to leave the security of the gear in the corner and stem and chimney your way up it a little to the outside. The pitch links very easily into the next pitch, the Narrows, and this is what we did. P10: The Narrows. If you skipped the 5.9 squeeze after the Wilson Overhang in favor of the 5.8 flake, then this is the unquestionable crux of the route. The Narrows was originally climbed by aiding up a bolt ladder on the outside of the slot, but ever since Robbins' ascents, the way to go has been right up into that hole. Approaching it, unlike Astroman's Harding Slot, is relatively easy. In fact, you can get most of your upper body into the Narrows while your lower body is still comfortably back-footing in the wider chimney below. The problem is advancing the next yard or so: One must drop one's feet and figure out some way to make upwards progress in a squeeze chimney using only body parts from the hips up. I managed this by using the back of my head on the back wall to pull my body upwards while simultaneously exhaling, then taking a deep breath to hold that position while I groped for a higher purchase with the back of my head. Hey, it worked. Gear for inside The Narrows really isn't necessary, but a fist-size cam (#3.5 Camalot/#4 C4) works well to protect the initial moves. For most of this you feel pretty alone with only the sound of your own gasping, and the tinkling sound of the hangers on the old aid bolts blowing freely in the wind on the outside of the slot, for company. Perhaps you'll wish you were out there hanging from those bolts, but perservere -- eventually things will start going a little more quickly. At last you can stem up out of The Narrows to an incredibly exposed position high on the upper face of the Sentinel. Peer down at the old bolt ladder, and the valley floor two thousand feet below. A few more feet of easy climbing leads to a nice belay. 5.9? Yeah, sure. P11: At this point a stout looking pine tree appears way above. This actually is the location of the final real belay on the climb. Not much further, huh? Continue up a fun 5.7 chimney to a very cool belay at bolts on top of a chockstone. P12: Continue up the chimney until forced to pull out left through a steep section at a hangerless bolt (plenty of gear to back it up). Belay where convenient. 5.8. P13: Aim for the tree. Head up and left through a very steep, but short, section of hand or fist cracks (switching between them where necessary). Some of this rock is fairly low quality, but after one last little mantle into the dirt and pine needles, you can taste victory. Belay at the big tree. P14: An easy pitch continues up the east-trending ramp at low 5th class, then steps around the corner and belays just below the summit. Descent: Before attempting this descent for the first time, take into account the amount of daylight you have remaining. If it's dark already, consider waiting it out and beginning at first light. You should try to do at least the first two thirds of the descent in the daylight. Part 1: Follow a passage east through manzanita and boulders until it turns into a huge gully that heads down to the east. Follow the obvious trail along the southern (right) wall of this gully until it eventually begins switching back down the center. This gully is often loose and very steep at times and requires much care to follow the trail, which is the easiest path. At one point a rappel is reached, but this is not necessary -- there is a 4th/low-5th passage down just before reaching the rap, but it appears improbable from above. Eventually you will reach a stream which must be crossed. Note: This stream is the one that crosses the Four Mile Trail just after the talus on the approach; it is also visible (as water streaks/wet sections of rock) from Camp 4 when looking up at the valley wall just left (east) of the Sentinel. The stream is spring-fed and safe to drink from -- a good thing to know when planning for how much water to carry on the climb. Part 2: After crossing the stream, begin heading north (left) on steep slabs. You want to stay in the middle of the slab or western 1/2 of it (near the Sentinel). The base of the slabs terminate in dense trees. Part 3: Continue scrambling down and east (right) along the base of the slabs to a non-descript point at which you enter the trees. Find the path of least resistance -- expect some bushwhacking. You can more or less head north and west to reach the climber's trail and the Four Mile Trail, but if you left equipment at the base of the ramp, you'll have to cut sharply back west to reach that point.",Two each from TCU's to hands.

The first 3 pitches are nice sustained 5.8/9, then the 5-7th pitches get harder. The 5th goes up a corner and you've got to get out of the corner and around the arete to the right.

Pitch 7-8. From the top of pitch 6, Pitch 7 climbs up and right above some blocks and shrubs into a mungy partially vegetated groove to an indeterminate end point. Pitch 8 continues up crack and face moves of to a chockstone and long narrow ledge. Finding no distinct comfortable belay on P7, we linked these two into one long pitch, belaying at a boulder at the top of the crack. Even w a 70m rope, this required simulclimbing for 15m or so on easy terrain to just below some more strenuous moves. Not recommended. 5.7, 5.8. Pitch 9. Move belay from the boulder right about 25 feet across a ledge to a rap anchor, possibly on Bircheff-Williams. Seriously consider rappelling from here (we assume it goes all the way down, but have no beta on this rap as we failed to consider it seriously enough).

Of note, the route also serves as a convenient introduction to the East Slabs descent route which is very nearby upon topping out.

Then, the remainder of the pitch can be linked into the start of the second pitch (crux), belaying at a nice ledge with a pine tree, continuing from there as described. P2 (10b, 130'): Step right and up off the belay using slick potato-chip foot holds and small finger jams in pin scars to gain a ""V"" groove. Using pin scars and groove follow the rising crack up to gain a ledge. Cross the ledge and belay at one of several trees. P3 (5.6, 120'): Step left to an arete and face. Climb the face up to a large ledge, 40 feet by 15 feet. The current guide books describe this ledge as having a tree but as of 2019 the tree is dead and lying down on the ledge. Alternatively from the belay climb a small hands/wide fingers crack 40 feet past a fixed friend to a small alcove. Step left to gain the face and climb to the ledge. 5.8 P4 (5.7, 120'): Climb up several ledges of 5.0 to gain a slab with a crack/corner on the right. Place gear and move left across the slab to gain a crack. Follow the crack and blocky system to a fixed belay on a ledge. ' P5 (5.8, 120'): Continue up the gully and crack system moving right to gain a left facing corner capped by a triangular roof. Work up and under the roof. Pull the roof to gain a stance on a slab/face. Follow a corner crack on the left up to a stance atop what is essentially a pillar. Belay here. P6 (5.9, 100'): Step up and left off the stance following a hand crack that splits. Note that the crack splits with one side, right, becoming a vertical thin finger crack while the other split trends up and left. Stay left using the wide crack/groove and thin face/slab to gain a ledge with a fixed belay, not easily visible from below. The anchor consists of two old pins, a button head bolt, and an old nut. Back up the belay with a 0.75 BD cam. P7 (5.9+, 130'): Climb past a few grassy steps to gain a large corner system. Face holds and wide crack climbing leads up the corner in along an every widening crack. Step left at the top of the crack using small face hands and foot holds to gain a ledge with two old pins. Climb up and past the pins stepping back right into the corner. Continue approximately 20-30 feet to belay at downward facing flakes or in a corner at the base of a left trending ramp. P8 (5.5, 160'): Climb the low angle face / ramp using chicken-heads, scoops and fins for 100 feet, placing gear in the corner where the ramp meets the main wall. At the top of the ramp, as seen from the prior belay, look right to find a vertical corner/crack. (option to belay here) Climb the corner and step right around the pillar to gain a horizontal traversing crack. Follow this crack right along the face to a second pillar with an old pin for an anchor and a small stance. Back up the pin with a small (red C3) and possibly other gear at the foot level. P9 (5.8, 130'): Down climb and move right to gain a vertical crack with textured face holds. Place small to increasingly larger gear in the crack, some what blind placements. Once the crack ends, continue up the face using fins, chicken-heads, and other features to gain a ledge with a broken slung pin in a 2-3 inch crack. Belay here or move up about 10 feet/3 meters to a second stance. P10 (5.7, 180'): Looking up, locate a massive square buttress. Aim for the right side of the buttress. Climb up following cracks and ramps to gain the face below and right of the massive buttress. Make several moves up a head wall and continue up the face as the angle reduces to a ramp. Turn the top of the buttress to the left following the crack. Belay at the next convenient stance. P11 (5.6, 90'): Climb the broken face up and right to a short headwall with a flake on the left.

It has a bit of a reputation as being hard, burly, and with less than perfect protection. I found none of these to be particularly true. The climb is truly a bit atypical for Tuolumne, being more reminiscent of Valley crack climbs with lots of wideness and flares. But after the first 30 feet, the rock is excellent, there is pro wherever you want it, and the offwidth is pretty tame and easily stemmed or face-climbed around. Phobos is maybe a slightly better climb (mostly just because of the awesome handcracks), but Deimos is still well worth climbing. Pitch 1 (5.9, 60 feet): Belay on top of a massive boulder at the base of some stacked blocks leading up to the prominent V-slot roof. Climb the blocks on good holds to reach the chimney, being careful of loose rock. Stem and chimney up through the slot to a single tricky move getting up and into the crack above (crux). Belay at a bad sloping stance shortly after the chimney, or continue higher to a better belay or to link pitches 1 and 2. Pitch 2 (5.9, 120 feet): This pitch links fairly easily with Pitch 1 if you sling your pro carefully around the roofs. Climb the slanting ramp/flare, using the wide-hands and offwidth crack in the back. Arriving underneath the roof, you will find a slung block. I think this spot would make a far more comfortable belay for Pitch 1 if you don't want to link the first two pitches. Pass the roof on the left at 5.9 with interesting stems and jams, or undercling out the right at 5.10b. Ascend the cracks above to an easy chimney, and step left to a good ledge for the belay. Pitch 3 (5.9, 60 feet): Traverse left across the ledge, then climb the obvious large flakes to the summit, past a single bolt-protected 5.9 face move. Belay from summit boulders.","Rack: set of nuts, single set of small cams (micros unnecessary), double set of C4s #1-#3, single #4 and #5. If you wanted to triple anything, I would bring 3 #2 C4s.

Free topo at supertopo.com/freetopos.htm… Start early, or move fast, or both. A very popular climb for the High Sierra. Start on the right side of the west wall - close to where the descent gully emerges. Class 3 ledges lead left across the face. P1 - Class 4 ramp/cracks lead to the first stiff bit - a 5.8 bulge above a short corner - a couple of moves regain easier climbing and a ledge below a steep vee chimney. P2 (long pitch) - A technical, steep, and strenuous pitch. The chimney is tricky, follow cracks and vertical flakes up and right, with another cruxy move before the old stance (and a bolt) - keep going up enjoyable and technical moves until right underneath the Red Dihedral, stiff final moves lead to a small footledge (small pieces), rappel slings located here. Some sparse protection in places. P3 (CRUX) - Your mates big lead. Steep and sustained 5.10- dihedral with good pro to the best rest beneath the bulge, over the bulge (5.10) to a step right, then big flakes to a belay alcove - a super-classic pitch. P4 (long pitch) - Around onto the exposed ramp which leads steeply to easier ground, with strenuous steeper bits (5.9), followed by a 5.6 ramp/groove to a ledge below the ""Splitter Crack"". P5 (200ft) - Nice approach to the splitter @ 5.10a (pure and classic), or a dihedral to the left at 5.9 (more varied) - it all depends upon what you like. Continue up more steep steps and cracks barely reaching a notch beneath the ""Shattered Pillar"". P6 - Left of the pillar, corner and cracks lead to a fierce lttle lieback and a superfluous bolt. Ledges then to a 5.8 lieback, then a ledge on the left. P7 - Up the easy corner/slab, then right beneath an overlap to a steep crack through a horizontal crack with a bulge (5.9) to step right onto a ledge/ramp, go right then up a steep crack, wander then to a ledge below a corner, and a wavy crack. P8 - The corner and crack (5.7) lead to a slab and the notch in the north ridge. P9 - The Class 3 ledge easily (with a final exposed step) to a chimney jammed with big blocks. P10 - The chimney at 5.8, over blocks to a large ledge. P11 (short) - The 5.8 corner behind (will it ever end?) and up the sandy ledge (ugh) to the bottom of the final chimney. P12 - The chimney (5.6) to the ""Keyhole"" where you make your final strenuous effort and are finally birthed by the Red Dihedral. Big people will have trouble - shed all gear.

The main drawback is the descent through Contact Pass, though you could bypass that by traversing to Gayley and Sill... This route has many variations and it's wise to take a topo unless you've climbed a lot on Temple. A good topo can be found in Croft's book or the High Sierra Supertopo book (the latter has some errors). However, Bruce Bindner (R.I.P.) posted a better topo right here ; it's the best I've seen and you will appreciate it once on the route. The rock on the route is overall pretty solid, but there are plenty of loose blocks that could kill you if you got careless. It would be a good idea to start early (regardless of whether you plan the ascent car-to-car or from a camp site) because Temple is plenty exposed to electrical storms.

You also get a sampling of what Tuolumne has to offer, from smooth slabs to wildly exposed knobby fins to choose-your-own adventure crack climbing. These three peaks form an obvious circuit from Tenaya Lake and make a great outing for any Tuolumne enthusiast. Many options exist for extending the link-up if you haven't gotten your fill. ROUTE DESCRIPTION NW Buttress of Tenaya Peak (5.4, 14 Supertopo pitches) Note that this route holds snow so it's best to avoid it until dry. The route is shaded in the morning so plan accordingly. There isn't a direct trail from the Tenaya Lake parking lot so either take the trail to the lake until you find the one that heads back NE or trample the meadow and cross-country through the trees toward the left-hand side of Tenaya Peak. You are aiming for the shrubby ledge system to the left of the route. As of June 2012 the trail was well worn and cairned. Supertopo has a blow-by-blow description of the route, but you can just as easily follow the crack systems up the obvious buttress. The route eases you into the steeper, more difficult climbing up higher. Several summit options exist of varying difficulty, including a 5.7ish hand crack and a 4th class option out right. The true summit is southwest of where you'll top out. South to North Traverse of Matthes Crest (5.7, many pitches; ridge is 1 mile in length) From the summit of Tenaya Peak head east between Tressider Peak and Columbia Finger then southeast after crossing the Cathedral Lakes trail to reach the southern end of Matthes Crest. You'll be able to see Cathedral from the Tenaya Peak summit as a bearing point. It's 2.5 miles as the crow flies and the only place you will likely follow a trail is the final ascent up to the notch that marks the start of Matthes. From the golden boulder choose a line up the knobby crack systems that lead to the ridgeline proper (5.5). The ridgeline is mostly class 3-4. If it seems too hard look off to the sides; there is usually an easier ramp down below. For soloists the easiest way off the south summit is to head back in the direction you came until you can downclimb to a tree on the east side of the can also do a more direct downclimb at 5.7. From here traverse north into the notch that divides the summits. From the notch mantle onto the ledges until you reach the leftward trending diagonal crack (5.7) which is the official crux of the route. Alternate: 5.8 corner offwidth From here climb the 5.4 chimney on the left side of the ledge to the north summit. Don't stop now. Continue on for more class 4 to low fifth class exposed fun. The final tower provides another short section of exposed 5.7 if you wish to partake. If not, you can downclimb off the west side (class 3-4) just prior to the second to the last tower. SE Buttress of Cathedral Peak (5.6, 5 pitches) From the end of Matthes Crest work your to one side of or over Echo Peaks/Ridge to Cathedral's SE Buttress (~1.6 miles as the crow flies). The most direct route is to aim for notch between Echo Ridge and Echo Peaks (left side of Echo Ridge). There are multiple routes up the SE Buttress. Refer to Supertopo if you need specifics. The most recent edition now includes the full traverse. Extra credit add-ons Echo Ridge (class 4), Echo Peaks (class 3 to 5.7), Eichorn Pinnacle (5.4) Descent From the top of Cathedral downclimb the 4th class summit blocks to reach the class 3 ledge system. If you are heading back to the Cathedral Lakes trailhead you will want the high saddle to the NE that leads to the trail that skirts the east side of Cathedral Peak. If you are heading directly back to Tenaya Lake continue down slabs/scree and through swamplands to the southern side of the main Cathedral Lake. You'll find a footpath along the shoreline. From the western end of the lake follow the drainage down slabs and cobbled river beds toward Tenaya Lake. I did notice a faint trail in certain section of the drainage but I gave up trying to follow it since it didn't really seem to offer any advantage over going straight down the drainage. About 1.5 trail miles from the lake you'll come across a bridge that leads to a good trail back to the lake and your car. The direct line mileage for the entire descent is ~2.7. WATER Availability of water will vary. In late season the seasonal streams between Tenaya and Matthes may dry up and require a detour to the lakes. The northern slopes below Echo Ridge/Peaks, however, tend to hold snow later and are a more reliable source. Worst case you can detour to one of the lakes.","optional: alpine rack, 60m rope Expect no fixed anchors.","Jul 20, 2022  ·  Solo."

Generally, people do the traverse from South to North. This is because the crest slopes upwards in that direction and therefore you will end up at a higher elevation. Doing it North to South would involve more downclimbing. Probably best to Simul or Solo much of the route. To rope up for every single pitch would take a horrendous amount of time. Start the climb at the South face above a patch of pine trees and stay a bit left. The climbing is <5.6 here and climbs very textured / featured rock upwards onto the ridge. Follow the path of least resistance. Once on the crest itself, just follow it along. When in doubt, check out both sides of the crest and traverse along the easier one. The crux of the climb comes on the left side (West) of the crest directly below the South Summit. Strenuous and physical climbing up a good crack leads to easier climbing and then the summit. Sign the register. From the South Summit: Do not rap, but rather climb back down the ridgetop for 100' and traverse past on easy ledges on the East side of the South Summit. Trying to rap often results in snagged ropes here. OR Simply continue the traverse and downclimb the next section, placing pro for the follower. Down into the notch between the two summits, then some 5.7 moves to get up onto the (higher) North summit. Some parties stop at the notch between the two summits and rappel down the very wide gully on the west side of the notch, straightforward with a single 60-meter rope. There are rock horns along the south side (descender's left). Might be slings/cord already in place, but safer to bring your own webbing/cord material and rappel rings. From the North Summit: Many parties stop here and rappel off the crest. Two double-rope rappels on the West side is easiest, but many parties have done it by three or four rappels with a single 60-meter rope -- see Comments on the route North Ridge of Matthes Crest ). Some of the rappels are on natural anchors, so bring some webbing/sling/cord (and rappel rings) in case the stations need new webbing. Continuing the climb offers great climbing, but the climbing difficulty increases so it is recommended you be solid at the grade. I'd say some of the downclimbing was 5.8. Retreat: It is probably best to bail off the West side at just about any point. There appear to be many rap stations at random intervals on the face. Multiple short rappels are best.

All 5 pitches have excellent climbing on very high-quality granite. While most of the climbing is on cracks there is a mix of face and chimney climbing on the route as well. It can be done with a 50 m rope, but a 60 m rope will make things easier. Supertopo has an excellent description of the route in their High Sierra Climbing book (1e p.108, 2e p. 164). Other good references include Secor's The High Sierra (second edition, p. 376), Croft's The Good, The Great and The Awesome (first edition, p. 183) and Moynier and Fiddler's California's High Sierra (second edition, p. 374). P.1 (normal start). From the initial horizontal ledge system, the route gets right down to business with a short 5.8 fist jam crack in a right-facing dihedral. One will be tempted to continue on the arete above the dihedral, but it is a bit simpler to traverse over to another 5.8 crack that heads up and diagonally to the right. At the top of this, the angle briefly lessens to 3rd class. Belay at a tree. P.2. Traverse left at the base of the face and start up towards a hand crack that eventually narrows to a finger crack. The climbing on this pitch starts at about 5.7 and has a few moves of 10a at the top of the finger crack. The system widens to an off width, but this section is most easily done by using the face moves available. There is a belay stance just below the off width, but things will go better on the next pitch if the belay is set up at the next opportunity above the off width about 20-30 ft higher up. P.3. From this belay there are many parallel cracks that head up to a large detached flake. The climbing here is approximately 5.8, but can be a bit harder or easier depending on the exact route taken. Once the flake is reached there are several choices here as well. Underneath the left side of the flake is a very enjoyable mid-5th chimney, while on the right side is more 5.8 fist jamming. Take your pick - it's good either way. Belay on top of the flake on a 12"" by 6 foot balcony with a spectacular view of Mono Lake. P.4. Directly above the flake is another 5.8 crack that leads to a short steep 10a finger crack. The 10a section can be bypassed by going right, but it is really very nice and well-protected. Above the finger crack is a difficult face section. The only pro here is small brassys or a piton after a rightward traverse on a decent handrail. Supertopo rates the difficulty of this section as 10a/b depending on if you go straight up the face or traverse right toward the flakes. There are other options, which are either run out or harder. Belay at a now dead tree. P.5. This part of the route has been described as ""the best 5.9 pitch in the universe"" (Moynier, p. 374). While most of it is 5.9, it actually has two short sections of harder climbing (10a or so) that some refer to as the crux of the entire route. Both are just above good rest stances and so pro can be placed and the moves contemplated. Note that the first difficult section comes early in the pitch and pro can be placed in a finger crack. A long reach will allow placing the pro while in a good stance, while a leader with a shorter reach will need to commit to climbing into the finger crack before being able to place the piece. Once a small roof is surmounted another good stance is reached along with the start of the next difficult section. This one involves a thin crack. It can be done as a lieback, but that's not the only way and may not be the best way... Place a small nut high before committing to the moves. From here the route gradually steepens and the pillar gets narrower, eventually narrowing to some 5 or 10 feet. Looking straight up to the point at the top with only blue sky behind can be somewhat intimidating! However, the climbing actually eases in difficulty here and has solid jams. The top is slightly overhung but is bypassed by traversing to the right (place good pro before traversing) and then performing a strenuous mantle. It's an awesome way to finish a route! ""The Third Pillar is a great little alpine climb on a very unique feature. The entire climb is pretty high quality, but its the exceptional last pitch that makes it a classic. There seem to be many variations to the route, but most commonly parties scramble up around the left side of the formation and then begin climbing there. Alternatively, the ""Croft variation"" basically starts at a low point and climbs up a large flake/pillar and up various crack and ledge systems to a fun finger traverse. Break down the pitches however you like and take whatever lines appear the best -- eventually, they will all funnel you towards the narrow pillar at the top of the formation. The crux is on the second-to-last pitch and passes a short, sheer face with a pin and a few RP placements. The last pitch is an outrageous overhanging hand crack with jugs just where they're needed most. Reminiscent of... believe it or not... the Gunks!""

FFA: Stan Shepard, Allen Bergen, 1957","One of the most classic climbs in the country, it begins right off the road on the Bastille, a 350' cliff on the left as you enter the canyon. Often crowded, a weekday is probably the best time to attempt this climb. The climb is north facing and in the shade until mid-afternoon. As Jim Erickson said in his classic 1980 Rocky Heights guidebook, ""avoid it like the plague if the weather is not warm, or you will shiver away much of its charm."" Start at the center of the north face of the Bastille, below a hand crack that starts 20' up the wall, with a huge, serrated flake to its right. The first pitch has been the site of numerous accidents, so make sure you're solid on 5.7 crack climbing and placing pro before attempting to lead it. P1. 5.7, 60'. Climb up to the flake and step left to the crack. Jam or layback up the polished crack (crux), then follow the crack up and left to a small stance at a 2-bolt anchor with chains. You can belay here (if you want to watch/coach your second through the crux), or continue with the second pitch. P2. 5.6, 90'. Climb up to the chimney left of the bolts, and step left onto the face. Climb up to a finger crack, then traverse right above a little roof (crux). Continue up steep, enjoyable cracks and angle up left on easy ground to a sloping ledge by a steep wall. Belay at a crack with a fixed pin. If this belay is occupied, it's possible to belay about 20' lower at another stance. Variation: near the top of P2, take a right-angling wide crack up and back left, 5.8. Bring a big cam (#4 Camalot) to protect this line. P1 & P2 can be combined with a 50m rope. P3. 5.7, 50'. Climb up into a pod, then work up past a small roof (crux). Continue up the cracks to another sloping ledge. A #1 and #2 Camalot are useful for the belay anchor. P1-3 can be combined with a 70m rope. P4. 5.6, 100'. Traverse left to a short corner with a destroyed fixed pin. Continue traversing left on awkward, off-balance moves past another fixed pin (crux). Go all the way left to a hand crack and climb it to a corner. Don't start up too soon or you'll be off route on a harder variation. Climb the corner, then continue up and right on easy ramps to a belay stance below or just right of a chimney. P5. Several options here: a. Easy finish: 5.4, 60'. Climb the chimney to the top. b. Fun finish: 5.8, 80'. Climb up a ramp right of the chimney to a huge corner with a wide crack. Climb up the face left of the corner to a fixed pin. Continue up the steep headwall and surmount a little roof at the top (crux). If you have a #3 and #4 Camalot, you can belay just above the roof (and watch/coach your second at the crux roof), otherwise continue up an easy gully and belay from a spike of rock at the top. c. Grovel finish: 5.7, 80'. Climb the wide crack in the corner just right of the previous variation. To descend: follow deep grooves to the south until you reach a dirt trail. Go 30' right (west) and then follow the marked Bastille descent trail north and down to the road at the base of the cliff. (Ed.

The start is the most intimidating part, but it is easier than it looks. Holds are generously placed in and around the crack and always where you need them. There are a few easy jams and manteling moves. It feels harder than 5.2 - it's steep, and the wind blowing through the canyon gives the climb some exciting exposure.

To the left of this dihedral, the 5.5 start is at the base of a rock scramble below a skinny juniper tree. P1: ascend boulders past the skinny juniper tree. Just above the tree, put in a directional piece of pro (an alien works well), and do a hand-traverse right on a thin ledge, then scramble up on a boulder.

Well, there could be dozens, but the climbing is all generally the same, and wandering a little here and there keeps the general difficulty at about 5.2. The only real difference from one section to another is how continuous the climb might be or how many trees and gullies you might pass along the way. Rossiter suggests going up from the low, left-hand edge of the rock past a few gullies to the most continuous and solid part of the face. This is perhaps 100 feet up and right of the very base. I agree that the climbing from this point is great. Climb up and onward, trending slightly left past flakes, cracks, and pockets for a few pitches to reach the summit. This is a fine climb at its grade and perhaps the best Flatirons introduction to slower parties and less confident leaders.

This is a very dramatic, challenging, and impressive route that takes the most direct line up the huge Wall of Winter Warmth. For a complete and rewarding ascent, try The Slit (9+, recommended and described below) or one of the newer bolted routes on the lower slab to the left (Alpha Bob 12a on the left or Leader of the Pack 11c/d on the right) as an approach pitch for a three star WWW outing. Every pitch has quality rock, with challenging, varying cruxes that range from wild hand traverses to balancey stems. Each has personality. The granite on this route is magnificent; a clean and smooth water polished white, sun bleached and reminiscent of high alpine granite. You'll certainly feel like you're on a big wall on the Left Side's 2nd pitch (3rd pitch here) belay. Approach via the Boulder Fall's tourist trail, escaping uphill to the west once near the falls. Once at the ""Keyhole"" above the falls, the Wall of Winter Warmth will be oh-so-very obvious to the North. Follow the trail on the west side of the river and cross where convenient to the slab at the base of the wall. P1: Start with The Slit (9+, see that route description for details) and run it out a full 180' to the huge pine tree directly above the Slit (not the one lower and to the left), crossing the slabby, grassy areas with caution not to dislodge rocks. Belay at the tree. P2 (Variation 10a): The traditional Left Side route begins from a slabby, grassy area below the impressive main Wall of Winter Warmth. The lower slab (which you just climbed) can be avoided by scrambling up a Class 3 gully on the climber's left (north) side; or an easy slog up the gully on the right and traversing left across the slabs to the base of the main wall. The original first pitch begins from here up a low angled slab with easy cracks that lead to a belay beneath a steep, black colored, grooved wall. A second pitch (the reported crux) ascends the Black Grooves to a nice size pine tree on a ledge. It appears these first two pitches could have been combined, but we chose not to climb them as we learned the Black Groove's signature colorings come from water flow. It did not appear to be very pleasant to climb when wet. We climbed this route in the driest year in decades and still found water in the grooves. I don't want to imagine what this would be like after a thunderstorm. We began at the huge pine tree uphill and to the right of the traditional start. Work up left from this tree along easy climbing, trending left toward the Black Grooves. Step up onto a ramp of sorts and follow left along good footholds above a roof, passing good cracks for pro. The footholds disappear and a finger crack will just reach your position from above and to the left. The crux of the whole route was a series of moves to get up into this crack, placing gear and moving over to meet the Black Grooves of the traditional start. The climbing isn't over yet, though, continue another 30 feet straight up along the left side of the Black Grooves to a perfect belay tree on a large, loose ledge. P3 (9+): From the belay tree, work right out onto an easy rib and then straight up following good cracks up to a steep slot of sorts with an overhanging finger crack on the left, and a smooth right wall for smearing on the right. To get into the slot, we worked a balancey, fun mantel problem up cool horizontal chicken heads in the middle of the face (careful - potential fall onto the slab or adjacent corner if you popped, plan pro accordingly), then stemmed up the wide slot using the left finger crack for pro (crux). Move left when available above the finger crack and belay from a nice stance on the arête. From the perch on the arête, a roof caps the route above and North Boulder Creek is a good 400' below you. The position on this belay perch is fantastic. P4 (9+): Work left from the belay through the roof (tricky) and continue leftward along discontinuous and flaring cracks toward another large roof that guards the top of the buttress. (Other variations exist straight up from the belay stance). The pro is tricky and the exposure is mind numbing on this upper face. Be sure to use long slings where appropriate to avoid rope drag. A crux 9+ section could be found smearing up smooth water warn granite. Wild granite folds and flakes are frequently passed.

The next pitch is 5.7 and goes up easy terrain to a hand crack that angles right to left. It looks difficult from below but is not too hard. You can see the anchor above. The last pitch starts up a chimney left of the anchor and follows a thin crack which moves left. This is a fun pitch and is 5.8. It protects with lots of small cams. A red tri-cam is great to have at the top. The pitch ends at a bolted anchor. There is an alternate first pitch about 10 feet left of the main start which is more direct. This optional start is 5.9 and protects well going up a left-facing dihedral before moving right below a protectable roof.",A standard rack up to a #4 Camalot.

High E,"Trad, 250 ft (76 m), 2 pitches",Hans Kraus & Fritz Wiessner - 1941,"High Exposure, aka High E. The climbing itself is flawless, but when one considers that the FA was done by pioneers Hans Kraus and Fritz Wiessner in 1941, it's even more incredible! The name, of course, is completely appropriate for this must-do Gunks mega-classic. The High E buttress is an obvious right-facing arete that is visible from the drive in from New Paltz. It is located about halfway along the base of the Trapps, right of the MF area and left of Bonnie's Roof . The High E access trail is about a 15 minute walk from the Uberfall. P1 (5.4, 180'): Begin the climb in a chimney/stemming corner left of the arete. Climb up this corner, only until it is possible to traverse up and right across the face, then climb up the face to a fantastic, spacious triangular belay ledge (this is the GT ledge) right on the arete below a large roof. Belay from natural gear or sling the huge boulder on the ledge. This pitch was originally split into two by belaying in the corner before heading out onto the face, but it can be easily combined into one with careful rope management. P2 (5.6, 100'): This is the money pitch, and is just about as exciting as 5.6... or 5.7 or 5.8 for that matter... can be. Climb up from the ledge (it's easiest to begin at the left side) and traverse right to the obvious place to turn the corner and make ""The Move"" to pull the roof - the exposure is immediate and the rock is steep! Continue up the face past gear, jugs, and fixed pins, trending left back towards the arete, until you top out. Exhilarating! Communication between the clifftop and the GT is notoriously difficult here, so plan accordingly. Descend the corner/gully to climber's right from three bolted rap stations with one rope. Also consider the Directissima variation instead of doing the original first pitch. Done this way, the climb checks in at 5.9, but you get what you pay for -- a first pitch that rivals the second in terms of quality.","Standard Rack.

Climb the corner to a roof, then move left and climb a crack to the GT Ledge. Belay at a big oak tree with rap slings. 5.6 PG, 120'. var: Rather than moving right to the corner, climb straight up the face. Gear in horizontals provide good pro, and there are very fun technical face moves to be done. At the end of the face you step right and then ascend the final crack that takes you to the GT ledge. 5.7/8 G You can also climb the enjoyable first 5.8 pitch of Erect Direction , a crack system on the left wall of Updraft, to get to the GT ledge. There are several options for the second pitch, with varying degrees of difficulty and protection. P2, option 1: Take the Updraft corner to a belay ledge in the corner. Safe at PG and easy at < 5.5. P2, option 2: From the oak tree rap/belay station, walk climber's right on the GT for about 20' to a pine tree. Climb past a short left-facing corner, with a thin crack to a stance at the overhang. Step right and climb past bulging rock (crux) to a stance. From here, diagonal up left to the belay ledge. This way is what Williams describes; you circumvent the crux overhang/notch of the third choice below, starting to the right and traversing left when you're above it. 5.7+ PG-R P2, option 3: From the oak tree rap/belay station, climb straight up the rock directly behind the tree until it's obvious to traverse right under the overhang. Traverse either high or low (awkward either way) about 8' right, make a difficult mantle past a bulge, then trend left up to the belay. Protecting the second is difficult to do well here. This is the start of CCK Direct's second pitch, at 5.8+ PG-R. Note: CCK Direct (5.9) continues straight up above the left-facing flakes and exits left out the roof. P3, the money pitch: Make sure the belayer has a camera; this is one of the best photo-ops in the Gunks! Step down and make an exposed traverse to the right on small edges.

Several alternatives: a) climb straight up the crack through the headwall at 5.11c. The gear is excellent but very strenuous to place. This is great climbing, although much harder than anything else on the route; as such, most parties opt for one of the other options to keep the grade consistent. b) climb up to a point about 15 feet below the headwall and traverse across a slab (5.9) to the crack system on the left ( Visual Aids ), then follow that to a belay. c) climb up to the headwall, place pro, and traverse straight right (5.10a) to a ledge/ramp, and follow that back left to a belay.

An inspiring, steep line from below, it offers a surprising amount of crack climbing (Colorado style at any rate). We found it to be a relatively fast grade III compared to others I've done in the Park. Hike up a short ways past the mountain's SE corner, and find a ramp that cuts back to the right. Go up that to the base of the route. The first 2 or 3 pitches are easy 5th Class, with many variations possible (usually simul-climbed). At a point where the wall steepens considerably, reach the highest of several terraces, a long ledge that runs off to the right. Almost all of the route occurs just to the right of the actual arete. P1. Face climb up and left for half a rope-length to a ledge below a right-facing dihedral (5.6). P2. Climb the hand and fist crack in the back of the dihedral, turn the airy roof with interesting moves, and face climb right, then back left to a belay--an excellent, exposed pitch (5.9, 100+ feet). The fist crack after the roof is very nice looking and seems to be the natural line, but I don't know how difficult it is (not in any guidebook). P3. Head straight up the crack at 5.8, and belay on a ledge on the other side of the arete/ridge (80 feet). Pitches 2 & 3 can be combined. P4. Two distinct variations are possible from here. The direct route wanders the onto the west face and eventually finds a 5.6 chimney which leads to a belay right on the arete. People often seem to get lost looking for this chimney - it's pretty far to the left. Prior to the chimney, there's a similar looking slot that's closer to 5.9. Supposedly there's a 10+/11 seam somewhere in this area as well. P5 of the direct route heads up and right to a beautiful, steep 5.9 crack. This pitch can easily be combined with P6, which is a 5.7 corner/groove. The original finish (from the top of P3) is as follows: 1) from the belay, traverse right across a prominent slab for 30 feet, and ascend a series of 5.8 cracks and corners slightly up and right to a belay in a large dihedral. Per Bogdan Petre : ""this pitch is less run out than it looks. Gear is hidden behind right-facing flakes but is plentiful enough to protect both the leader and the follower. Mind the square meter-sized triangular block at the end of the traverse. It's detached but looks deceptively stable when climbing up past it from below. It isn't until you pull over it that you'll realize how easily it could be pulled off and sever your rope. Use it sparingly."" 2) climb the dihedral to the top (5.7). Both pitches were fairly long.

Solo Flight,https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105839405/solo-flight,4th,2.6,45,All Locations > Colorado > Alpine Rock > Indian Peaks > Lone Eagle Peak,"Trad, Alpine, 5280 ft (1600 m)",unknown,"This is the easiest route to the classic summit of Lone Eagle Peak and in reverse is also the descent from any route summiting Lone Eagle Peak (including Solo Flight itself). While ""only"" 4th Class, it is very exposed and features devious route finding on terrain that quickly exceeds 4th Class if a wrong turn is taken, which can easily happen despite the numerous cairns en route , especially when climbing the route for the first time in reverse after an ascent of the N. Face route. I won't say anything else about that other than if going in reverse, look in every direction for the next cairn, and don't misinterpret a random pile of rocks!! I excerpt here almost verbatim (differences in []'s) from Gerry Roach's description of Solo Flight, from the 1989 Indian Peaks Wilderness Area Guide. The differences are mostly because it seems to me that some of the directions were off. Also because if you try to follow directions too carefully on this climb, you have to enjoy being totally confused, so I'm trying to confuse you even more (e.g. just follow your nose). From the northeast side of Crater Lake, climb southeast to a point just below the north face of Lone Eagle Peak. Continue climbing southeast and stay below the cliffs of Lone Eagle Peak's northeast face. The easiest going is actually right under the cliffs, and you may find some wonderful flower displays at the base of the rocks. It is also reasonable to hike across talus some distance below the cliffs. Stay below the cliffs and continue south to a point where you can look down on Triangle Lake. It is 0.5 miles from the base of the north face to this point. It is not necessary to go to Triangle Lake, only to see it. The cliffs of Lone Eagle Peak finally start to relent, and the route ascends southwest up a ramp bordered on its north side by a dwindling cliff band. Look sharp for a good place to leave the ramp, and climb northwest (right) up through this cliff band. There are at least three places to ascend this cliff band with 50 feet of Class 3 climbing. Some cairns mark the upper two places. Once you are above the dwindling cliff band, traverse north on a broad ramp. You are finally headed toward the summit instead of away from it! After 200 yards of traversing, do an ascending traverse northwest up broken ledges to a pair of small notches in the convoluted ridge. This ascending traverse follows the path of least resistance and involves an occasional Class 3 move. The two notches are [along a spur from the north-south ridge]. The view north from the [southeast] notch can be disheartening at first, but at least you can finally see the summit. It is 250 yards north and below you. The summit is not the highest point on the ridge, but it is the farthest north. Climb [south] through the [southeast] notch, and descend 20 feet on the [southwest] side of the ridge (Class 3). Turn [northwest] (right), and climb 30 feet into another notch with a curious chockstone in it (Class 3). From here on, the route is exposed and more serious. There is a steep gully descending north from the notch with the chockstone in it. Get on the west side of this gully, traverse north, and descend slightly to a series of easy ledges 100 feet north of the notch (Class 3). There are at least two ways to accomplish this maneuver. These ledges are on the east side of the ridge running north toward the summit. Traverse north 100 yards on the ledges (Class 3). When the ledges bump into cliffs, descend 70 feet east down a south-angling Class 4 pitch to a lower series of ledges. This pitch is the crux of the route and can be downclimbed or rappelled. If desired, a rope can be left in place on this pitch to aid the return trip. Traverse north 200 feet on the lower series of ledges (Class 3), and engage the single closed contour of the summit. Ascend 60 feet northwest across the east side of the summit ridge to the summit (Class 4). The job isn't complete until you tiptoe north 30 feet on the narrow ridge to the most spectacular point. This is a complicated route, but take heart. It follows the path of least resistance, consists mostly of easy Class 3 scrambling, is festooned with cairns, and, most important of all, leads to an incredible summit.","It has 4th Class sections, so take pro if needed, as do off route 5th Class variations.

The long approach to Lone Eagle Peak ensures solitude, and the cirque itself is unmatched for beauty in the entirety of the Indian Peaks. Despite the moniker, most of the climbing takes place on the east side of the peak. Scramble southeast up a steep grassy slope for 200 yards from Crater Lake to the base of the east face. The route starts from the talus field just over the crest -- look for a large, tree-filled bench. P1. Climb wet black rock (5.4) past a pin, aiming between the two large trees on the bench. P2-4. Follow a 5.0 ramp up and south (climber's left), climbing over, around and through numerous trees en route. You can break this bit up or simul-climb. It's mostly 3rd and 4th class.

This is the easiest route on the Diamond, but that doesn't mean it's not world class. The route includes incredible climbing with awesome exposure and high alpine weather. Although I have heard the route described as both stiff and easy for the grade, I think that the published ratings are quite accurate. P1: Start in the middle of the wall at a less than vertical broken pillar. It is not hard to find. Pitch 1 is 5.4 up broken ground to the bottom of an obvious crack. P2: Follow the steeper crack at 5.9 to a hanging belay 2/3 of the way up. P3: A 100 foot 5.7 traverse with about three pieces of pro, two of which are fixed pins. This pitch is spectacular and has dangerous fall potential, although the climbing is easy. Per Ellen S : although this pitch is described as runout, you should be able to keep the distance between pieces reasonable (10-15 feet at most) with the right routefinding choices. P4: Climb up a dirty 5.8 crack and chimney to a belay about half way up the route. P5: May be the best pitch of the climb. It leads up a steep 5.8 dihedral with a handcrack tucked in the corner. Belay halfway up the dihedral on a stance and continue up 5.8 to the Yellow Wall Bivy Ledge. The exposure hits you right here for the final, and crux, pitch. P6: Climb up a really thin 5.9 crack with fixed gear to a 5.8 squeeze chimney. Trying to squirm your way up the chimney at 14,000 feet is about as strenuous as it gets. From here pull out of the chimney and perform the crux move, a well protected reach over a bulge on thin holds, 5.10a, and you're on Table Ledge.

Move up on good face holds toward a crack. Find good pro along this crack with wires and small-medium cams. The crack fades and you clip a bolt.

It is not too long but is one of the most elegant lines possible. It begins with a long scramble up a ramp 5.0 (left of the Roof Routes), to some 5.2 soloing. It is hard to describe exactly how to get to the base of it, consult a guidebook. Per Carl Sampurna : a less-exposed alternative to the Lower Ramp is what Levin calls West Face of Lower Ramp, which starts below Suparete at a large right-facing dihedral and continues up and right (blocky 5.0) to the top of the Lower Ramp. The first pitch is a 50' horizontal traverse above a roof. The exposure consists of 150 feet of air straight to the ground, very exposed. The first half of the traverse is the crux, but the second half will still keep you pumped. Make the weaker climber in the party lead it as it is scarier to second it. The belay is semi-hanging off some fixed webbing (or wires) that can be backed up with nuts a little higher. If you haven't climbed in Eldo much, you might find the pitch a bit burly for the grade. The second pitch is 60' long and goes up a steep and beautiful 9+ finger crack to a ledge with two bolts. The crux is about 3/4 of the way up. The third pitch is .9- and about 110'. Start with delicate moves, go up to a bolt, then make a big stem to the right. Easier ground continues up the upper ramp, where you can belay off a large tree with [no] fixed gear. Descent: with one rope, you can rap off Vertigo (up the ramp from the finish) or the Naked Edge (down the same ramp, including a 5.4 move). With 2 ropes, you can rappel the route and end up halfway down the approach ramp. You may have to leave gear on top to get down to the P1 anchor.","Three really short pitches.

The rock is mostly very good and clean. It is a 3-star line if climbed through the best and most continuous features. To borrow from Nick's comment below, perhaps for greater clarity since a few people have reported poor conditions on their scramble: ""the key to keeping the climbing fun and clean on this route is to maintain your position just a little ways down and climber's left of the crest of the NE Rib.

P6. Climb a cruxy overhang (11 for tall folks, harder for shorter folks), and move up a short 5.10 wall to a 2 bolt belay on the right, a great ledge at the base of a water tube (4 bolts). Short folks can aid the roof with a long sling or two. A judicious belay spot can keep the rope out of the way of the leader, perhaps dropping down the ramp about below the belay. P7. Move up the water tube to the top, and belay at a tree (6, 80 feet). A #1 Camalot, a large and a small wire, slings, and two bolts protect this pitch. Descent for The Stanley Hotel: scramble off the back side of Mary's Bust to the rappels on Devil's Backbone . If you can't surmount the 5.11 overhang, and don't want to aid it, downclimb the 5.3 5th pitch and then rappel the original route.

With that said, I want to thank Richard, Mark, and Koko for their excellent route Solid Gold . Their efforts on Solid Gold are the only reason this route was even possible. So we thank you. Start with the first 2 pitches of Solid Gold . I recommend linking both for a full value, 200 foot rope-stretcher. This either takes a lot of draws, or some discipline to skip a few bolts through easier terrain (make sure your belayer is tied in and ready to go, and you belay from the lower of 2 anchors on the ledge).

P2: (5.8, bolts, 100 feet) is also 100 foot long and is largely quite easy with a couple of 5.8 sections, one right off the belay. It finishes on a ledge at a double bolt belay stance. However, for descent purposes, a higher rap anchor was installed that keeps the rope running clean and off the ledge. This stance is ten feet higher than the belay stance. P3: (5.7, 2 bolts, 40 feet) this is essentially a pitch to move your anchor slightly higher before stepping over to Playin' Hooky. Belay on the large grassy ledge at a 2 bolt anchor. P4 (5.8, 14 bolts, 150 feet) time for some exposure! Step right from the belay, clip the first bolt, dodge a bush, and embark on 140 feet of fun climbing with a steep exposed finale.

Red Face Magic,https://www.mountainproject.com/route/119134066/red-face-magic,5.8+,3.5,29,All Locations > Colorado > Alpine Rock > RMNP - Rock > Otis Peak > Zowie,"Trad, Alpine, 650 ft (197 m), 6 pitches, Grade III",unknown,"This route, which I heard about on a trip report on stephabegg.com, is a link-up of the three primary routes on Zowie and takes an amazingly direct line to the summit. The first pitch is 5.8+ and the price of admission for the rest of the route. The technical climbing is broken up by two bouts of 5.easy but allows for linking pitches with a touch of simuling while the second is on easy terrain. When I climbed the route, we combined pitches 2 and 3. There are many great belay opportunities on this route, especially on the lower half. I feel like the route is PG-13 because of the lack of pro pulling the roof on P1, especially if you don't clip the block of death. However, the holds are huge, and a fall would be unlikely. It seems a lot of people compare Zowie to Petit. In my opinion, the average climbing quality on Petit is better, but no single pitch is better than pitches 5 or 6 on this route. The easier approach and descent to Zowie make this route a great entry park tower in my opinion, but the first pitch should not be attempted by someone only claiming to be a 5.8 leader. Descriptions below include approximate pitch lengths. Any updates with firmer numbers would be greatly appreciated. P1. Climb a prominent, left-facing dihedral system that arcs to the left at the mid-point of the pitch. As it arcs, face climbing becomes the name of the game while you protect in the crack system. This pitch is 5.8+ which lines up with what I heard about + ratings meaning ""it's harder than 5.8."" After pulling onto a ledge with rap slings, traverse around left to pull a small roof on huge jugs. Work up to a large belay ledge on 5.easy terrain on the right side of a gully. Be careful not to step on any of the many large, detached rocks here. (~150 feet, 5.8+). P2. Traverse climber's left across the gully and work up to the base of a prominent chimney. The crux of this pitch is getting across the gully, maybe 5.3, maybe 4th Class. There is a perfect 0.4 X4-sized pod to pull onto the face for the crux move (~120 feet, 5.easy). P3. Climb the chimney working up to a squeeze. Drop your pack, and wiggle up the squeeze, finding easier ground above. I've seen descriptions that rate this pitch 5.6, but maybe they weren't taking the squeeze. In my opinion, it's every bit of 5.7 (~100 feet, 5.7). Update: avoiding the squeeze and stemming around it definitely makes P3 go at 5.6. P4. Work up more broken 5.easy terrain to the base of a small roof and corner system. This pitch is forgettable, but the rock quality is good. If you belay right above the chimney on a large ledge slightly right, there are two variations to access the easy terrain. One option is to navigate right, up, then left to a short 5.8 offwidth section. Another option is to go straight up from the belay which is generally pretty easy but has a well-protected 5.9 finger crack move before accessing the easy terrain. There is loose rock on the next pitch that is mostly avoidable but do not belay in a position where you would be directly in line with anything coming down. P5. A stellar pitch! This is what climbing on Zowie is all about. Some descriptions claim this pitch is 5.9, but I don't believe any single move is harder than 5.7. Work up to a roof, and traverse out and around to the right, regaining the corner system and climbing a stellar hand crack to the next belay on a ledge with a giant leaning death block. The exposure at the back side of this belay is amazing, don't forget to take in the views (~100 feet, 5.7). P6. This pitch is maybe better than pitch 5 depending on your preferred style. There are two options here, taking the offwidth to the left or a face/crack climb directly up the center of the face. Take the face option, trying to not put too much torque on the death block as you work up from the ledge. Work up the face enjoying excellent holds and great movement, belaying at the rappel anchors at the back side of the summit on climber's right. Some descriptions say this is 5.8, but compared to the first pitch, there is no comparison (~80 feet, 5.7). Descent: rappel from bolts on the summit down to a ledge (60 feet), and walk to the north end where you will find another set of bolts. Take this rappel (80 feet) to the top of the descent gully, working down very exposed but secure 3rd Class terrain with a short scramble in the middle. A pair of brown rap bolts will be skier's right at the very end of the gully where it cliffs out. Take this rap to the ground (60 feet).","A standard alpine rack.

The first pitch is well protected 5.9+, and the crux is pulling over a right-facing corner roof about halfway up. It has 8 or 9 bolts plus anchors. The moves are fun, and it's the safest bolting on Mission Wall so far. The second pitch is classic Clear Creek steep 11c jug hauling. Right now it ends on the grassy ledge where the two climbs to the left of Wild Child also end. There are no anchors on Wild Child's second pitch, so you either have to traverse left to top of other routes or lower off top bolt of this route. I intend Wild Child to be three to four pitches in length when it's finished.... From Jan. 1, 2005: Wild Child is now four pitches in length. From the top of pitch two, climb out the overhanging crack-chimney (10a dirty), at the third bolt undercling left onto the slab (do not climb straight up, it's more chossy). Cruise easy rock for a while, then friction past two bolts to reach Surette Ledge and a chain anchor. Actually it is more comfortable to belay off bolts found at the back of the ledge, the anchor I placed is for the descent. Pitch three is 10b. Walk 15 feet right on Surette Ledge to a two-bolt belay station. Pitch four is high quality and exposed 10d/11a. Start with a delicate undercling/layback past three bolts through a steep, quartzite headwall to a crack, note the old ring angle piton in the crack (do not clip this). A long reach right allows you to clip the next bolt. Hand traverse right and fire through steep face (crux). Continue up 5.9 to a two-bolt anchor at the top of Mission Wall. You can walk off to the South or rap the route. Wild Child and most climbs on the Mission Wall are more adventurous than your standard Clear Creek clip-ups. There are still loose sections, lichen, fractured rock, and broken ledges. Surette Ledge is full of talus, so be very careful. If you rap the route, you may encounter rope hang-ups on pitch three. If you are inexperienced with multi-pitch or alpine-like rock, this route is probably not for you. If you are a solid 5.11 leader who likes adventure, then Wild Child is a fun outing.

I drilled new anchors for "" The Green Zone "" nearby and after that climb was in, took a TR lap up the corner and found it to be yet another CC classic.

I recommend climbing the right crack to the top. Step left on a narrow ledge and place gear. Proceed upward using a combination of crack and face holds left of the dihedral and roof seen from the ground. Several more cracks and ledges lead to a stance at about 100 feet with a wide crack on the left which is the start of P2.

P2-more of the same out on the left, to a passable ledge. More specifically, follow a wide crack to where it peters out. Follow discontinuous cracks and face to a roof/overlap. Make an awkward move over the roof and continue up about 15 feet to a horizontal ledge with a splitter crack and the P3 stem moves about 40 above. Belay here. P3-Head up into two shallow, opposing corners. Stem them (5.9), continue past a ledge and over a 5.9 bulge to another ledge below a large, right-facing corner. After the bulge, the crack slips into a left facing ""corner"" which really feels/looks like a big flake for the right-hand wall. Make an awkward move into the corner/v-slot. Continue about 15 feet to a giant ledge at the base of a large right facing corner. P4-climb the corner at 5.8 and belay on a low angled area or continue up P6 to the top.

After P4 and the slabs, look for a 12-18 inch wide crack which is narrow in the back and accepts gear from .5 to 3 or bigger. Climb on the left side and inside the crack for about 60 feet. This crack/offwith/chimney is the most parallel sided feature above the slabs. If you linked P4 and P5 run the rope about 190 feet before looking right for a ledge system. You may want to summit at this point as this system is used as the walk-off. One does not actually summit the west side of the buttress to descend. If done as a separate pitch you may have enough rope to continue further but you still may want to stop at the ledge system to walk off. Head east to the descent gully. More specifically, climbers should look for a relatively large ledge system which contours around the side of the buttress. It is not at the true summit but level with the east summit. Walk/scramble east looking for tracks of prior climbers. If you get lucky, as of 2021, there is a permanent anchor attached to a large dead tree. The tree sits about 40 ft below the ledge system.

FFA Larry C. Schubarth, Tom Austin, April 1980.","The Maiden Voyage is straightforward, not very sustained or long, and except for the first pitch, has excellent rock - a great intro to Black Canyon climbing! It is recommended over the Leisure Climb in that respect, though the actual climbing is no better. Reach the base by heading down the Cruise Gully to shortly past the second rappel. Look for the prominent Checkerboard Wall to the east (upstream). The route is one of the most obvious lines in the Black, as it ascend the narrow west face of the wall (in other words, not the main, namesake face), in a prominent, continuous crack/corner system, the whole length of which lies just left of the wall's SW corner/arete. Bushwhack up from the Cruise Gully to the base, and start in thick trees and bushes. NOTE [2019 edit]: while I describe this in five pitches to the walk-off ledge, the route is typically done in three to that point with 60-meter ropes these days, combining one & two, then three & most of four. P1. The worst pitch: identify a dirty wide crack that starts the system, and climb the face to its left until it is easy to get into the system. Belay beneath an overhang whence a clean right-facing corner emerges. The pitch is easy but a bit dirty and loose, and the rock at the belay is poor. [2019 edit: sounds like this pitch has cleaned up quite a bit over the years] P2. Climb over the overhang past a flake wedged in the crack, and continue up the thin corner (crux), then through an easy chimney to belay on a nice ledge. P3. Ascend the obvious, wide crack above (5.7), then go around either side of a roof (5.8--if going right, traverse back left under the next roof). Belay on a small ledge below a large dihedral with double cracks. P4. Ascend the corner and cracks, superb 5.7, and continue to another good ledge. P5. Continue up the huge easy dihedral to a large ledge with trees. The 3rd Class ascent to the canyon rim begins here; however, the route finishes with a sixth pitch (that many skip) up the summit block above with an obvious crack and corner over on the left, about 5.6. Rappel from the summit block 105' back to the ledge from a two bolt anchor. A 60 meter rope will make the rappel if you stay climber's left on the rappel and touch down on a block where you started the pitch. Tie knots in the ends or your rope! Now a long ascent must be made back up to the rim; follow the ledge off NW into the left of two wooded gullies and take that all the way up. If you don't mind a bit of 4th Class scrambling and lots of route-finding, (and want to avoid much bush-whacking) it is possible to take the ledge leading left from the base of the gully, and then scramble up a fun 3rd/4th Class ridge to the rim.

With the ""Sex Comedy"" finish, a great pitch of 5.10 can be done instead of trending right into the very mediocre exit pitches of the Leisure Climb . Afternoon shade, a short ""approach"", and fast, well-protected climbing add up to a nice afternoon romp, something to do if you arrive at the Black in mid-morning and feel compelled to leave the beer cooler and campground.

Pitch 4 climbs 5.6 rock, clean and fun, up the buttress - do not trend right into Leisure Climb - to a ""green"" wall below a steep, sharp, hand-sized crack formed by a flake splitting the vertical gray wall above (this is ""fresh"" stone, i.e. somewhat newly fractured).

It looks like a pile from the ground but has pretty good climbing and exposure on the first three pitches. The final pitches are very low-angled and loose but go pretty fast if you find the easiest line. Be wary of climbing beneath another party on this route, and also be aware that there have apparently been some bad accidents on the crux pitch which is runout and also easy to get off route onto harder climbing. 2022 Edit: perhaps the most common way to do this route these days is traverse into A Midsummer Night's Dream for its great 5.9+ third pitch, a long airy corner with good gear and lots of jugs and stem rests. Then, once on the terrace, do the 9+ direct finish, which is similar in difficulty, quality, and protection. Doing the route with both of those pitches makes for a reasonably protected outing that is one of the better moderates in the Black. Go down the Cruise Gully, and find the route shortly after emerging from the second rappel. The first pitch is identified by a right-facing 5.8 corner with a wide crack up high (avoid the harder crack systems and roofs to the left). Access P1 by scrambling up and left on blocky third class to a ledge. P1. Ascend the large corner, and belay on a grassy ledge at left. P2. Take the obvious, acute left-facing corner above the belay (5.8). At its top, angle right on a ramp then back left to a small belay ledge below a flake system. P3. This is the devious crux: go up a left-facing flake/finger crack, toward a triangular overlap/roof. Angle rightwards where the corner ends, and climb further up a thin crack past the right end of the overlap, to a sloping ledge. It is easier but scarier to place pro in the crack and then traverse a ways back left to turn the roof on bigger holds, then run it out on ~5.7 terrain to the ledge above. Staying with the crack the whole way as it dies out is the more obvious line, but probably 5.10-something and still a bit spicy. Probably a better variation to this pitch (certainly better-protected) is to traverse up and left (easy but a little runout) into the large right-facing corner of A Midsummer Night's Dream's third pitch, which is great climbing. It's slightly harder than P3 of Leisure Climb but is better protected. It's also easier to stretch the rope a bit farther than on Leisure Climb proper. P4. Go right up easy ground a short ways (to avoid a steep section) then back left up a long, broken and bushy corner. Belay at its top, or (some simul-climbing required) go directly up fun face-climbing for about 35 feet to another good ledge. P5. Go easily along the base of a steep cliff on 3rd Class, then climb up a chimney to belay on the right end of huge, forested ledge (hard to see from the start of the pitch). If doing the Leisure-Summer version, you can just barely combine 4 & 5 with a 70-meter rope. P6 (optional direct finish): walk left along the ledge 200-300, passing the Happy Ending and the huge corner of Kama Sutra . Around the corner from those harder finishes, look for a nice fingers to hands crack that leads up to a ledge with some blocky overhanging peg above. This 9+ direct finish has lots of climbing at the grade, but also lots of rests, and protects well--similar in those respects to P3 of MND. The climbing is great and shouldn't be missed if time permits.

From Sundeck Ledge, climb up to a chockstone, mantle over onto a ledge, and continue up the very large and steep left facing corner (double cracks), with fantastic stemming and jamming and plenty of rests.

The route starts near the NE corner of the Bastille, right off the road and about 50 feet east of The Bastille Crack . Walk just past the first steep buttress ( March of Dimes buttress--about 50 feet high) that lies on the road, 100 yards or so west of the parking lot.

From the small ledge, follow a beautiful thin crack and shallow corner. Belay from bolts on a sloping ledge about 120 feet up. I recommend stepping left to the ledge 5 feet or so before the crack ends (especially if your second isn't solid--the bolts are not on top of the crack), (5.8+). P2.

From the gully, either head down to rap slings around trees (sketchy, not recommended), or boulder up a large chockstone and continue heading east. A rough path through the talus spits you out at the upper end of the parking lot. If you finish on March of Dimes , you can rappel 80' from chains to the top of P1, then rappel 120' to the ground.

You can probably combine P3 and P4 with minimal rope drag as well. Per Carl Sampurna : an alternative P4 is to head straight up towards a flaring flake (#3 and #4 sew up the moves around this flake). Directly above this flake is the bolted rap anchor. Descent: as of 2018, there is now a set of three rap anchors, making the descent much faster and easier. Be careful of knocking rocks off on parties below! Find the first set of anchors on the slab to the east of the summit, on the north edge. The bolts are on the TOP of the rock surface, with long chains that go over the edge. You may have to go slightly down the slab to get to them.

P4: no bolts. From the oasis, continue up and left around the corner to the top of Helen's, belay from gear (#2 Camalot suffices), (5.4) approximately 100', no bolts! Now, the hike. Go across Helen's summit slabs and work your way up the saddle to Acid rock. On the far right side of Acid, right of the large corner is a series of low-angled dihedrals and flakes.

I used to think Sheep Rock was probably climbed back then, because Kevin and I found a single angle piton rap at the top of the crack. Later, at the old CMC library on Alameda, I found a Trail and Timberline account of the clubs preference to climb the low angle southwest slabs and then rappel off the summit via Acid Crack. Kevin and I didn't rappel, because we simul-soloed the crack ropeless. Kevin was a Keanu Reeves look-alike; a surfer dude from Cali who showed up ready to learn climbing in 1973. When I told him we could walk off the back, he believed me. Oops! After dropping and climbing, we came on to the realization that there was no walk down the back. So I down-soloed under Kevin with the idea that if he slipped I'd spot him off the excellent finger locks. We didn't know that Colorado Springs climbers had been calling the area ""Acid Rock"".

Bolts were added by the first ascentionist, so don't go chopping. The first four pitches are the best and most sustained, IMO. All pitches offer climbing at or near the 5.10a level. Most of the cruxes are slab moves and well protected. There are only a few sections that could be called runout, but all on easy ground (5.6ish). One thing to keep in mind is that just because the bolt line is railroad straight doesn't mean the climbing is. Often you'll climb left or right and step back to clip the bolts. P1: 50m, 5.10a slab climbing past a small lip for 9 bolts. Slight runout 2/3rd of the way up. Follow the last 3 bolts up left into the chimney.

Follow the bolts up the arete past several roofs with jug holds to another good stance. Awesome pitch with fun moves! P3: Longer pitch, 5.10a up and right following the bolts.

It is not too long but is one of the most elegant lines possible. It begins with a long scramble up a ramp 5.0 (left of the Roof Routes), to some 5.2 soloing. It is hard to describe exactly how to get to the base of it, consult a guidebook. Per Carl Sampurna : a less-exposed alternative to the Lower Ramp is what Levin calls West Face of Lower Ramp, which starts below Suparete at a large right-facing dihedral and continues up and right (blocky 5.0) to the top of the Lower Ramp. The first pitch is a 50' horizontal traverse above a roof. The exposure consists of 150 feet of air straight to the ground, very exposed. The first half of the traverse is the crux, but the second half will still keep you pumped. Make the weaker climber in the party lead it as it is scarier to second it. The belay is semi-hanging off some fixed webbing (or wires) that can be backed up with nuts a little higher. If you haven't climbed in Eldo much, you might find the pitch a bit burly for the grade. The second pitch is 60' long and goes up a steep and beautiful 9+ finger crack to a ledge with two bolts. The crux is about 3/4 of the way up. The third pitch is .9- and about 110'. Start with delicate moves, go up to a bolt, then make a big stem to the right. Easier ground continues up the upper ramp, where you can belay off a large tree with [no] fixed gear. Descent: with one rope, you can rap off Vertigo (up the ramp from the finish) or the Naked Edge (down the same ramp, including a 5.4 move). With 2 ropes, you can rappel the route and end up halfway down the approach ramp. You may have to leave gear on top to get down to the P1 anchor.","Three really short pitches.

The highlight of climbing OCS is the (in)famous ""jump move"" on the lead of the third pitch, where you have to leap across a gap between the spire's ears to a small stance on the far side. Exciting stuff! For the North Face-West Crack, start on the North side in a right-facing corner (see pictures). P1) Climb initial corner crack, then either go straight up, or out onto the face and climb to a steep exit slot and a pair of belay bolts. Move the belay from here up to a ledge just below the next pitch crack. P2) Climb the tight-hands crack to gain the flared chimney above. If you have big hands, this may feel like 10-. Once in the flare, climb to the big blocky chimney above. You can belay here if you want to break it up a bit, or just continue up the blocky chimney the top of the lower OCS tower. This lead is about 185 feet if you go all the way. P3) Locate the proper jump, down on a lower ledge across from the other tower. Get some slack and make the leap of faith. Not a good idea to fall. Then climb left, then up, then back right and up a last crack to a (visible from the jump spot)bolted anchor on the wall. The actual summit is another ten feet higher and includes a mailbox. Belay up to and down from here accordingly.","Standard rack up to #4 Camalot, two ropes, HELMET!!","Mar 28, 2021  ·  Lead / Flash."

The first two pitches are laden with loose rock, so use caution. The last four pitches are four stars for climbing quality. This is also one of the best summits in Sedona. Pitch 1 - Walk to the left edge of the large starting platform. Climb a short crack then wander up broken rock and ledges to a nice belay ledge next to the Chimney. (5.7 ~120') Watch for loose rock on this pitch. Pitch 2 - Climb chimney off belay being mindful of loose rock. Belay at nice ledge on left at the top of the chimney. (5.7 ~180') Pitch 3 - Step across chimney and climb off-width crack above. Jam, stem, off-width, and face climb past one bolt (pitch crux) to the top of this excellent pitch. Everytime this pitch starts to really become difficult a Red Rocks style face hold seemed to magically appear. Belay from a huge ledge at the top of this pitch. (5.10- ~150') Pitch 4 - Climb the left side of a pillar up a hands to fingers crack. Belay at the top of this pillar. Some say this is the best pitch on the route. The first asensionists tunneled behind/through the pillar and climbed the right side. (5.9 ~100') Pitch 5 - Traverse up and right to a finger crack that is not directly visible from the belay ledge. Climb up this crack and then onto the face above past an old bolt and pin. Once through the major difficulties trend up and right over large chickenheads to another huge ledge and belay. (5.10- ~140') This pitch carries some serious climbing above an old bolt and pin. Send the best lead head and face climber up on this pitch. Pitch 6 - There are many ways to climb the final pitch ranging from 5.7 to 5.10x. The described way was our path of least resistance, but there are probably 5 or 6 different ways to climb this last pitch.

The facts are as follows: Start up on funky, hollowed, pockety rock to a high first clip (red home made hanger). Get ready to crank.

It lies on the Southwest face of The Red Slab (aka Rainbow Wall per P. Hubbel). Colorado Crags by P. Hubbel, p. 147 has an topo of most of this climb. When driving down the canyon, it catches the eye of a trad climber with a moderate-sized face although it turns out to be much lower angle than it appears from a distance. There are at least 2 trad lines on this face. This is the better of the two that are on this site. ' The Corner , 5.8' to the left is marginal at best. This first pitch of this face stays shady until afternoon; however, P2 & P3 bask in sun earlier. The climbing is 2-3 pitches in length with potential to scramble off after 2 pitches; however, this appears exposed. This climb has a nice bit of slightly runout stemming on P2 sandwiched between scruffy terrain. Approach this as for the Red Slab, parking South of US Hwy 6 just East of the bridge below The Little Eiger. I prefer the lower traverse that starts below the level of the road. Arrive below the Red Slab via the obvious trail, continue W past this on a still obvious trail. The final bit is talus-covered. P1. Start about 30 feet right of the large chimney bordering the left side of this face in a crack-like system. Follow the features up and what-feels-like-slightly-left (though is drawn in on P. Hubbel's topo as trending right). A crack-like feature to the right seems quite brushy. There is still loose rock here. This face is low-angled enough that you could probably climb anywhere; however, this line has pro. Gain a large ledge about 150 feet up, 5.7. A #0.5 Camalot is nice for this belay. P2. This pitch is probably PG-13 with less-than-abundant pro opportunities for the cluckers (like me) out there. Move slightly right into a large, right-facing dihedral. Use a #2 Camalot just above a bush at the start of the pitch because your next pro is 30+ feet up. Find a fixed, small Camalot at the first crux. A small cord or thin kevlar sling may allow you to thread the hole on the Camalot, but a spectra sling or sewn 9/16 inch won't work. A green Alien can fit just above it. Surmount the bulge (9-), scamper up to the crux dihedral. Alternatively, here you can move left (9, high step) or possibly right (arête) or head up the obvious dihedral. You can find an orange Alien placement left of the dihedral. If you go up the dihedral, there is a hidden finger pocket, but expect fun, delicate stemming moves hidden pro opportunities for wires. Gain a large ledge with few anchor options (yellow Alien, wire, #9 or #10 hex). Continue up the next block perhaps 30 feet to a large ledge, 5.9- or 5.9 (left variation). #0.75 & #1 Camalots & a red Alien are useful for this belay. From here, you may be able to scramble off left, but it seemed a bit exposed. P3. Scramble up & right to a dead tree.

The crux, in fact, is fingers - but the steep hand jamming above is quite good. The Hand Crack is located in an enclave of the upper West Ridge called the Cirque of the Cracks (a fittingly vague name since the West Ridge comprises 2000 feet of cirques and cracks). Fifty meters uphill from the Quartzite Ridge, locate an alcove with several obvious, chalked crack lines. Look for a steep hand crack (the Hand Crack, yes) about thirty feet right of a prominent, serrated, corner crack (the Duh Dihedral ) and immediately right of a clean, left-facing dihedral ( Terminal Velocity ). Heavy chalkage marks the way, especially around an overhanging section of 2"" crack forty feet up. The route appears unremarkable and discontinuous from below, but does provide some quality action and varied climbing - slabby fingerlocks, steep hand jams, an arete slap here and there. Jam the Crack through a tour of sizes and belay in a comfortable chimney below a loose ledge or traverse left to a slung tree atop Terminal Velocity (a few feet left/north). Either way, mind the abundant loose rock on these ledges. Rappel Terminal Velocity . Rossiter calls the FA Unknown; can any historians (or seniors) out there set the record straight?

Consistent pitches, easy routefinding, and solid crack climbing is what this is all about. We had a smile after every pitch! P1: scramble up to the chimney that is The Mail Ridge, and go slightly right. Start climbing here. Go up the short, left-facing dihedral created by a large, triangular block. Gain the top of said block, and move right into another left-facing dihedral with a slight bulge. Move over, and follow the crack up (crux of pitch) to the nice ledge. Try belaying a little to the left of where you end up on this ledge. P2: attack the roof, and follow the crack up the right-facing dihedral about 15 feet left of where the previous pitch left you. Follow up through a slot, and belay on an open face before you get to the large flake that continues on your path up the right side of the wall, 5.9. P3: follow this flake up - and what fun! Super-positive and nice and airy. Use your extra #3 here to protect, as it's a little blank. Rossiter suggests moving left halfway up this flake and continuing on the arete, but I think it's just as fun to follow the flake up and out. Belay anywhere you want on the great break ledge at the end of this flake, 5.7. P4: the crux pitch starts about 15 feet, 90 degrees to the left of the direction of travel you were maintaining as you finished the flake. It's a steep, slightly meandering hand crack that ends with a small roof, which you surmount by passing to the left and then stepping left once over to a great belay stance.

It is long, not too sustained, and a beautiful direct line. The climbing is all pretty straight forward. The 5.10 variation on the second to last pitch is kinda stiff for .10a, but is really well protected on bolts. The last pitch is runout but easy. The direct start is not too bad, more of a high boulder problem than anything, although I had a friend who sprained his ankle on it once. P1 direct. Scramble onto it and arrive shortly at some caked-on chalk and pin scars below a break in a long roof band. This was Kors original start; it is 5.10 and protects with tricky small stopper placements. P1 standard. A much easier start ascends a short dihedral 20 feet to the right. Cut back left, then climb further up huge holds over the exciting roof, and head right to a tree belay-5.9 (about 30 feet of elevation gain). P2. Go up left, then up a fantastic dihedral, with face moves at the end, to another tree, 5.8. P3. Head up cracks and corners to a rotten band; continue over a scary bulge and another crack to a beautiful, exposed ledge, also 5.8. P4. Fifteen feet right of the belay, ascend a large, moderate dihedral. Hand traverse right, avoiding a huge overhang, and climb another 5.8 corner up and then right to a small, exposed stance. You can also belay on a large ledge 10 feet lower with less exposure. P5. Climb straight up, make a delicate step right into a thin crack (with several pitons) and ascend that (the crux) to a scary detached flake [now gone]. Make a beautiful ascending 5.7 traverse up left to lower angle terrain and a belay on the arete, or climb straight up past bolts at 5.10 and reach the same belay. P6. Head up the spectacular 5.6 arete to the summit of Tower One.","A standard rack up to 3"". Per Danny Gilbert : there's a lot more fixed pins on this route than (6). I know the route pretty well, and from memory: P1 - 3 pins ( 2 now ) (one before the traverse above your head, and (now one) at your feet before you pull the roof). P2 - 2 pins ( now one - the one just before the 5.8 dihedral is gone , and one right in the dihedral). P3 - 1 pin ( 2 now , the 1st is old style, with the ring on it in the first open book). There is one more above a semi-rotten ledge. P4 - 2 pins and a bong ( now only 2, one pin in that easy low 5th section, one pin just before the hand traverse. The bong is at the top of the hand traverse is gone ). P5 - I think there's 5 pins? All of them in the 'Pin ladder'. Then you've got two finishes, the bolt ladder has 3, and the Robbin's Traverse has at least one pin before the belay. I can't think of any on pitch 6 (depending on where you belay after the Robbins Travers, there is 1 more pin either high on P5 or low on P6) .

The climb begins just down below the prominent, chalked-up ""roof routes"", right where the roof begins. If taking the trail that passes C'est La Vie and Genesis , you'll discover the start after rounding a corner and coming out of some trees. Begin by hand traversing under a small roof and go around it on the left (first crux, #2 Friend). You can also thread a runner or large wired nut through a hole to protect this crux. Turn the roof, and continue up thin opposing flakes to a ledge/groove. You can set up an optional belay here from good gear. This is a good idea if you expect your second may have trouble at the crux roof. Follow the groove up left to a thin, obtuse dihedral and climb than with perfect fingerlocks to a bolted belay. The second crux comes at a bulge near the top of the dihedral. You can protect this with a small cam in a pod in the corner. Descent options: * A double-rope rappel from the top anchor. * A single rappel with a 70m rope from the top anchor will just barely make it to the ground. * A single-rope rappel from the top anchor down to the anchor below the dihedral (top of Scratch and Sniff ), and a second single-rope rappel from there. The stance at the Scratch and Sniff anchor is a little awkward and a bit to the left of the top anchor. * Traverse over to the top of the second pitch of Redguard , and do two single-rope rappels from bolts/chains down Redguard . Variations: all three dihedrals just to the right of the start are climbable at similar grades with less-than-ideal pro; a great variation, called Bolting for Glory , is to climb the first half of the route to the groove, and then continue straight up past 4 bolts on 5.10a face climbing.

Ed Lynch & John Pease, 1974","Both Stewart Green and Peter Hubbel consider this route to be one of the best routes on Sheep's Nose. I think it's a great way to get Lost in Space. This route is but one of the many fine lines gracing the southeast buttress up to the 8,894 foot summit of Sheep's Nose. With a short approach through the ponderosa pine and a sunny southern exposure, this route is a year-round classic for everyone. From the parking on Douglas County Rd. 68, hike along a shaded trail up through the boulders to the prominent southeast face in about 15 minutes. Lost in Space begins on the lowest point along the face in its southeast corner and climbs up into a large, right-facing corner near the summit. To start, look for a ledge system with a small pine tree growing out of a right-leaning corner about 75"" off the ground. There are many variations and alternatives to the first pitch. Pitch 1: 5.7 or 5.9, 80'. Look for a 5.7 hand crack leading up and right into an easy 5.5 corner that continues up to the tree at 70', or run it out over the slabs for Cheap Thrills at 5.9. Belay on a comfortable ledge above the tree. If this pitch has snow or ice on it, try Lamb's Prey , a hand and finger crack 30"" to the right, 5.9-. Pitch 2: 5.8+, 130'. Move above the belay, and traverse right for about 10"" around an arete to gain a steep fingercrack. Follow this crack straight up to some very airy moves with good holds along the arete and into a shallow dihedral above. Continue up for another 20' to a nice ledge, and belay. Pitch 3: 5.9, 100'. Head up and left in a thin crack. Where the crack ends (crux), move out onto the face, and make a few delicate moves up the slab. Climb up easier ground to a 5.4 corner above. Scale the corner on large holds, and belay on a spacious pedestal above the corner. Pitch 4: 5.7, 150'. Jamalama up the right-facing corner in a clean 5.7 hand crack with perfect protection for about 100'. As the angle kicks back and the corner fades, run it out over the summit slabs up to the top. Belay and enjoy the view. There are a few other excellent options to this pitch including Ozone Direct which follows the zig-zag corner system to the left of Lost In Space, 10a. Descent: scramble and downclimb off to the left side. There may be snow on the descent in winter months. Watch out for the yeti. Per Doug Haller : as of June 2022, there are two rap stations on the west face. Each uses Metolius rap bolts and large quicklinks. They are hard to locate. A 70m rope works for each rap with extra rope. If rapping with a single 60m, watch the ends.

It begins roughly where the approach trail ends (take the right-hand branch just before the rock). The climb starts at a clean right-facing flake just right of a broken area. Fifteen feet to the right is the obvious, thinner left-facing flake of the first pitch of Loose Ends . P1. The flake can be climbed directly from the bottom (5.9 R), but the standard start is to climb up the slab right of the flake and step into it where it offers a perfect hand crack (5.7 with no pro for the first 20 feet). One can avoid all these scary starts (but also some great climbing) by scrambling up around to the left to get on top of the flake. In either case, from the top right side of the flake, follow thin cracks (crux) up to a belay on a sloping ledge. P2. Follow the ledge up left to the edge of the face, then cut back right into a crack and follow that to a belay on a perfect small ledge (5.4). A much nicer way to do this pitch is to climb the left of two finger cracks (P2 of Loose Ends ) off the initial ledge and then step left above; however, this is much harder than anything else on the route. P3. Follow a perfect hand and finger crack above the belay for 100 feet (5.8), then traverse right under a small roof to a belay on another fine ledge. There are a couple other ways to do the top part of this pitch. One can traverse along a horizontal break about 20 feet below the roof, then up and into the big Loose Ends corner where a 5.9- move leads to the belay ledge. This is a great way to do the pitch, but as with the variation on pitch two, it bumps the overall route grade up. Or, continue around the left side of the roof leading to some slightly runout 5.8 climbing and eventually easier ground where you can set a belay. I'm not as fond of this last option. P4 & 5.

The dike continues up much of the wall, receding into the fabric of the cliff at times, but prominent at other locations -- the route chases this dike. This fun climb has 6 pitches of bolt protected on great rock with great position. The Brown Palace is the famous hotel in downtown Denver built by Henry Cordes Brown (begun in 1888 and opened in 1892). A labor of love by its first ascentionists, who include Bernard Gillett, Paul Bodnar, and Jim Bailey did the FA of P1; Mark Ronca and Gillett for P6 (part of ?There's Something About Mary?); and Gillett, Paul Foster, and Ronca for the middle pitches. The FFA of the entire route was completed by Gillett and Foster. P1. Start at the left edge of the main wall next to a pine tree. Clip the first bolt on Proud Mary , and then traverse upward and right to a ledge. Move right to a bolt on Deceiver , and continue up and right past two bolts and a delicate move to a two-bolt belay on the right side of the brown dike, 9-, 70 feet, 6 bolts. P2. Climb the brown dike (or a little easier on the right) to its top, then move right to a flake, place an optional #2 Camalot, or do two more moves to the next bolt. The climbing gets harder (10): stem a corner, move left, and finish with a great jug to a bolted belay at the base of a prominent rib (with chains), 10, 9 bolts, 85 feet. P3. Ascend the rib (brown dike) with bolts to a chimney. Stem (note a big, hollow flake at the base), and then move left onto overhanging rock. Delicate climbing goes left and up around a bulge (11-) to a ledge with two bolts, just right of the last pitch on Proud Mary , 11-, 9 bolts, 85 feet. P4. Climb straight up a discontinuous column (part of the brown dike formation) to a small overhang. Decipher a crux, easier for the tall. Belay at two bolts in a pocket above the overhang, .11-, 4 bolts, 40 feet. P5. Angle right to a easier, nice slab. Pass two cool chickenheads. Go up to an overhang, and crank over (10- to 10+).

The first rappel goes past the last belay ledge to a station that you used as pro on the 5th lead. Knot your ends! To avoid rapping over other parties: 1. You've done the first 3 rappels and are atop the 3rd pitch, with the bolts of Proud Mary to your left. Swing left on your next rappel to find the rappel station for Proud Mary (it is not on the route; read its description). Then rappel straight down to the anchor on top of Deceiver , and then to the ground. 2. Scramble off the back side to the rappels on The Devil's Backbone . Begin by roping off to the NE (40 feet of 4th Class), and then head for an obvious pine tree. Go through a notch to its left, and carefully downclimb the 3rd Class slabs on the back side of Mary's Bust. These lead to a saddle between Mary's Bust and a short gold wall behind it.

This is the longest pitch and the best of the three. Belay on a big ledge (5.8+ 130 feet). P2. Take the corner to the right, and crank up the large dihedral.

P3. Continue up the right-facing dihedral. The technical crux occurs after #2 Friend placement. This is your last placement for the next 15 feet. Move up through the thin, balancy crux, and finish left on a large ramp.

You can rap off after the first three pitches. For the second pitch, you can take the rover variation on the left side of the block, this is a lot easier than it looks, but still solid 5.9. The other variation is the Ruper crack, an offwidth that requires a #4 Camalot at the beginning. (You can pro in cracks on the side of the offwidth higher in the pitch) The other pitch of note is the last pitch. This is has one short .8- move on it, but the protection sucks. There are two pins protecting the move, one wiggles around when you touch it, the other would not hold a fall. You can back them up with some weird TCU placements, all the same be solid at the grade.

Not a bad pitch or belay station on this climb. Pitch 1 (5.7) is marked by a tree located well to the climber's right of the arete proper. Straightforward to the belay at a good stance with a block. If traversing in from the Caves area, you won't start at the tree (nor will you be able to see the tree), you will probably rope up and traverse in about 40' above the tree then my suggestion is to make an intermediate belay as there is a flake that catches the rope which could give you fits as you try to belay your second to the start of P2. Pitch 2 (5.8) is the most serious & sustained of the climb. You follow the natural line which is somewhat flaring & somewhat OW. There is a pin at the crux, but it will not protect you until after you move through it. Focus & be solid at 5.8, this pitch is a fight. Belay at a huge ledge, take a breather, & rehydrate. It is possible to escape this route going to the right at this point (If you wanted to get a couple of pitches in while camping @ the Meadows before heading to the Grand - this is a good venue). There are 2 raps, we used 60M, I don't know if a 50M will allow for you to escape without burning gear. Pitch 3 (original - 5.7) Cross over the arete back & forth on a roofy pitch with a black rock band; really cool face climbing with roof pulls. Reminds you of Eldo. As I was moving across the arete, what was a calm morning became a gusty alpine day. Scared the shit out of me, as my position was on the edge. Finish at an obvious good belay ledge. (variant 5.9, is climber's right and follows up a natural line going back left into the black rock band. I think R. Rossiter has a picture of the 5.7 in his guide book. I wish I took a pic of the 5.9 variant, totally committing section right off of the ledge.) Pitch 4 (original 5.8) traverses left, protection available before a leader moves around the arete, but for a second, a fall will be a wild ride (it is a clean traversing fall) out & off of the arete. Then climb up through black rock on good holds. This next section is really wild, face climbing traverse back right on quartz (this is where that 2"" white crystal is); just trust the feet, it's all a sequential section. At this point it hits you, this route is a classic. There is a fixed piece that you probably should back up with a cam to preserve its placement due to vectoring of a second fall traversing on this section and the pin is looking not too good. Belay is at a sloping ledge with a fixed pin and gear seam. (Variant 5.8: natural line climber's right of the arete, this looked good and really sustained. I may have to give this section a go.) Pitch 5 (original 5.7): climb climber's left of the sloping ledge up cracks & face moves up to a horizontal knife edge. HOWEVER, right in front of you is an excellent 5.9 slightly overhanging fingers-to-hand crack through a short quartz section. With jugs available to help you escape out of this section (an off-balance move, just do it - also, take a look down over your left shoulder, oh man!). Once at the horizontal knife-edge, do a short leapfrog over to a tree. Pitch 6 (original 5.7): go down & right about 150' (though this looked like a shorter distance to me) and up a short weakness (R. Rossiter has this at 5.5). BUT, natural 5.8 line right in front of the tree was my choice. A quick trip to Vedauwoo will prepare you for this pump fest; great hands in a meat grinder with poor feet. This variant looks unappealing but really has some good sustained fist crack moves. Exit & move to find easy slab belay. (Variant 5.9+/.10a: I didn't climb this variation. From comments received & reading R. Rossiter's description, it may very well be a good variant. This variant is located climber's left of the 5.8 handcrack, taking on the arete crest more directly.) Pitch 7 (5 nothing): solo, simul, or belay, similar to East Face Flatirons climbing, but on igneous rock (good quality rock also), for a couple hundred feet up & left (then moving climber's right - just follow the easy line). We also saw some minute garnet crystals along the way. The walk-off will appear and be obvious to the right. Find a bush, take a leak, & a drink; take it all in you just climbed a classic!! If I left out/misinterpreted anything on the variants, please comment, I'll go climb it again; it's a fine route. I also went to the AAC Library to research printed history, but not much else was offered other than to say something to the effect that 7 pitches of difficult climbing were accomplished on the FA. An interesting bit of history printed in the Alpinist 16 from Irene's perspective about this route. If it's a classic, who am I to argue??","Pro to 3"" with a few fixed pins. Tape gloves not really needed but can be helpful for the final 5.8 fist crack variant. A single rope is all that is necessary (we used 60M - but others may know if 50M is ok, hell, the route was probably established with a 50M.

This ledge can be easily viewed from the Lower Saddle if you know where to look. Begin from the Lower Saddle as for the Owen Spalding, passing left of the smooth pinnacle known as ""The Needle"", then up the gully on the right, close to the Needle. If you are lucky you will find the tunnel above here known as ""The Eye of The Needle"", but it is not necessary to pass through this feature. Above here your route diverges from the Owen Spalding as you traverse right, crossing a broad and relatively easy couloir to the start of Wall Street. This couloir drops straight down from the Upper Saddle and has led to disaster for many tired climbers descending from the Upper Saddle, assuming it is the way down (it cliffs out). Take note of it. The Wall Street ledge is huge and easy to walk along, until the very end where it suddenly becomes exposed and narrow. Rope up here, unless you feel like repeating Glenn Exum's famous leap. Actually, I've never seen anyone leap to span this difficulty, as you can simply make a long step or hand traverse. Still, it is very exposed and only climbers in a great hurry will do this unroped. Next comes the Golden Stair pitch, which ascends directly up the ridge up a steep, knobby face. This pitch looks harder than it is, because it is very exposed and the protection is not abundant. Plenty of knobs make the climbing enjoyable. After this pitch the difficulty eases and if your party is experienced you may want to pack the rope for a while, or simulclimb. Follow a horizontal section near the ridge crest, then move left to gain access into a gully which slants up and right. This is called the Wind Tunnel. This leads, after a number of pitches, to the base of the Friction Pitch. When the Wind Tunnel gully begins to lean back to the left, this is the point where you exit it straight up to the base of the Friction Pitch, which is back on the crest. If you follow the gully too far, it turns into more of a ramp and eventually ends. This is easy to do as it is the path of least resistence. If you make this mistake, either backtrack to the Friction Pitch, or head straight up to the crest up a chimney, rejoining the route above the Friction Pitch. The Friction Pitch is called by some the crux of the route, it is not well protected but the difficulties ease shortly. Above here scramble for 2 more pitches, following the line of least resistence. Look for a section above where you can cross back to the west side of the crest to avoid a slabby tower. Above you is the ""V"" pitch, one of the most exposed on the route. Climb the obvious SW facing dihedral above, with excellent protection. I feel this section is the crux of the route. After this pitch the ridge levels out and is quite easy for a short section. The next difficulty encountered following the crest is called the Petzoldt lieback pitch. When I last did this pitch in September it was covered with ice and quite a challenge in rock shoes. Above here you can climb a small 10' tower directly via a crack and in another 100' the ridge becomes broad and nearly level.

Don't forget to register at the Visitor's Center before and after the climb. This is a crowded route and a few minutes can mean the difference between success and failure. Either plan to arrive around 5:30 AM or, if you're fast and have headlamps, try to start in the late afternoon. Note: All directional references in this description are accurate if you are facing the rock. Approach: You have two choices here. To walk to the base of the 1st pitch... hike up the trail from the Visitor's Center and head to the right at the Tower trail. Almost immediately head left on a faint trail that angles up toward the base of the tower. Continue up an easy ramp to the base of the leaning column and the start of the Durrance. To climb up to the base of the 1st pitch... Continue hiking on the concrete Tower trail to the South side of the tower. You'll come to a clear path just past the leaning column as you look up. Take this path past the registration reminder sign for 5 minutes to the base of the tower and the 1st pitch of Wiessner's route. Climb this 5.4 crack to a couple of bolts about 100 feet off of the deck. Traverse left (if facing the wall) on easy 4th class to the base of the leaning column.

Enter the chimney behind the pillar and ascend another 25feet and exit onto the top of the column to a nice belay ledge with bolts. Pitch 2, Durrance Crack (70 feet): A two crack system heads straight up for about 70 feet. The left crack is hand-width and accepts good pro for about 50 feet. The right crack is off-width and contains a large chockstone. Good pro can be found in the left hand crack until you get to the chockstone at about 55 feet. From the chockstone, depending on how tall you are, you must commit to the right crack and face the crux of the pitch. Save your #4 Camalot or equivalent to protect the crux. If you do not have anything this size, you'll probably be climbing the last 15 or so feet of this crack high above your last piece. Exit to your right onto the belay ledge with bolts. 1 Piton available about 15 feet up. Pitch 3, Cussin' Crack (30 feet): Climb a face and off-width combo to a small ledge 20 feet up. Protect this with a number #4 or #5 stopper or equivalent on the flake to the left of the crack. From the small ledge traverse right on a 1-foot ramp to an easy and well-protected hand crack. You also have the option of continuing straight up from the small ledge in an off-width... but the right side crack is far easier. Exit onto a nice belay ledge with bolts. Be sure to run some slings from your pro to reduce rope drag if you go to the right side crack. Pitch 4, Flake Crack (40 feet): Ascend obvious crack system on right side of huge belay ledge. A number of flakes protruding from the crack (hence the name) and some face holds for the feet will make this quite enjoyable after the off-widths lower on the route. Exit via off-width (go figure) with bomber hands onto yet another great belay ledge with bolts. Watch for some loose rock on this pitch. 1 piton is available about 15 feet up. Pitch 5, Chockstone Crack (40 feet): Head up into a large off-width or chimney, depending on how big you are. The first 20 feet are fairly basic. The top half of this pitch is a little harder and finishes with an overhanging boulder that you must clear to exit. It will get the blood flowing, but has some decent hands to keep it relatively tame. Exit to a large belay ledge. For the first time on the route... you may be able to find some shade in a large crack on your left. Belay your second from the bolts and prepare for the jump traverse. Note: you can look down and right to spot the bolts for the second rap that you may use for your descent, they are a little harder to spot when rappelling, as they will be below you after your first rap from the summit. Pitch 6, Jump Traverse (15 foot traverse): From the belay ledge on top of Chockstone crack, down-climb 5 feet to a small ledge. Traverse under a small roof to a horizontal finger crack. Traverse finger crack and reach back for the ledge that marks the _landing zone_ for the _jump_. Very few, if any, people actually jump on this pitch and it is not recommended. Most use the piton just around the roof to hold onto and keep the rating 5.6. If you eschew the piton, you earn a 5.8 rating for this move and the climb. Continue through a small tunnel (a nice shady spot to rest if you need it) right of the jump traverse and across the meadows to the far right crack system and climb 100 or so feet to the top. Some rope up for this section and some parties don't. Enjoy the summit. Pitch 6 Variation, Bailey's Direct (150 feet): From the top of Chockstone crack, ascend up a 5.4 crack (left of the bolts) that goes back and forth between hands and off-width. Exit onto the summit. This finish avoids the jump traverse and has the aesthetic appeal of climbing directly to the summit. Note that the right option includes more difficult off-width moves about 40 or 50 feet off the belay. Rappel: From the summit head back towards the top of Bailey's direct and down-climb a few feet to a rappel station. Your first rap will put you back in the meadows near the jump traverse. Down-climb to your right to some bolts below and right of the jump traverse. Make three more raps down the Bowling Alley a few hundred feet right of the Durrance route and just right of Wiessner to the base and go get some water. All raps require 2 ropes. Be careful to always rap over the nose of each pillar and NOT in the crack or else your rope will be eaten and get stuck. Be prepared to answer all manner of questions from tourists as you race for the water fountain. Bring lots of water and conserve it. A truly classic climb.","Standard Rack, #4 Camalot, 2 ropes, slings.","Jul 25, 2020  ·  Lead / Onsight."

Montgomery & K. McIlrath, 3-18-10","Finally! A mega moderate that graces the slabs of Creekside. This is a long 1 pitch route that steers clear of the hard last 2 pitches of Solid Gold and stays consistent with the difficulty of the first 2 beautiful pitches of that route. With that said, I want to thank Richard, Mark, and Koko for their excellent route Solid Gold . Their efforts on Solid Gold are the only reason this route was even possible. So we thank you. Start with the first 2 pitches of Solid Gold . I recommend linking both for a full value, 200 foot rope-stretcher. This either takes a lot of draws, or some discipline to skip a few bolts through easier terrain (make sure your belayer is tied in and ready to go, and you belay from the lower of 2 anchors on the ledge). P1: (5.9,bolts, 100 feet) this is a 100 foot pitch that goes on glue-in bolts and finishes at a double bolt anchor. The rock is solid all the way and kicks out a couple of fun spots. P2: (5.8, bolts, 100 feet) is also 100 foot long and is largely quite easy with a couple of 5.8 sections, one right off the belay. It finishes on a ledge at a double bolt belay stance. However, for descent purposes, a higher rap anchor was installed that keeps the rope running clean and off the ledge. This stance is ten feet higher than the belay stance. P3: (5.7, 2 bolts, 40 feet) this is essentially a pitch to move your anchor slightly higher before stepping over to Playin' Hooky. Belay on the large grassy ledge at a 2 bolt anchor. P4 (5.8, 14 bolts, 150 feet) time for some exposure! Step right from the belay, clip the first bolt, dodge a bush, and embark on 140 feet of fun climbing with a steep exposed finale. It is possible to walk to the summit from the top of this pitch. *There is an intermediate rap station to the right of the climbing line - this allows you to get down with a 60m rope; a 70m rope will not get you back to the ledge with out this anchor!* Descent: 4 near-100 foot raps with a 60m will get you back down. R1: from the top of Playin' Hooky, rap 90 feet to the intermediate anchor in the slab. R2: knot your ends. Rap 100 feet down to the top of the 2nd pitch of Solid Gold . R3: knot your ends.

Six pitches takes you to the summit of the Middle Buttress via Rebuffat's Arete . Start at the base of the West Chimney below the Middle Buttress about 15 feet left of an alcove. P1 has a steep start but is only 5.6 up a nice crack (~110 feet). There are two cracks starting here. The thinner crack on the right is The Great Zot (8+) and is one of my favorite 5.8s in Eldo. Take your pick. P2. Climb an easy pitch up to the Red Ledge arcing left. Look for a large eyebolt. P3. Continue up the left-facing dihedral to a belay stance on the right (6). P4. This is the crux and most exciting pitch. From the belay, traverse the hand crack left, pull around the arete, and continue up the steep and exposed hand crack. Belay on a ledge to the left of where previously existed a large, detached block or the right. Caution: this block fell down; this 6 foot high piece of rock used to rock back and forth if you pulled on it! P5. Follow the crack to the right (5) or straight (8) up Rebuffat's Arete . The arete is recommended as it more spectacular. Belay at a tree in the large V on the left. P6. Find a clean, 5.5 crack to the summit. This is a great short pitch also with a nice view and bomber gear. Per Doug Haller : you can combine P5 & P6 with a 60 or 70m rope and save a belay, 140'. Descent: downclimb a notch to the North back to the West side of Redgarden Wall. The notch is beyond several towers to the NW. If it doesn't look like easy 4th Class, keep going. Per joshua larkin : there is now a bolted rap anchor west of the topout.

FFA: Stan Shepard, Allen Bergen, 1957","One of the most classic climbs in the country, it begins right off the road on the Bastille, a 350' cliff on the left as you enter the canyon. Often crowded, a weekday is probably the best time to attempt this climb. The climb is north facing and in the shade until mid-afternoon. As Jim Erickson said in his classic 1980 Rocky Heights guidebook, ""avoid it like the plague if the weather is not warm, or you will shiver away much of its charm."" Start at the center of the north face of the Bastille, below a hand crack that starts 20' up the wall, with a huge, serrated flake to its right. The first pitch has been the site of numerous accidents, so make sure you're solid on 5.7 crack climbing and placing pro before attempting to lead it. P1. 5.7, 60'. Climb up to the flake and step left to the crack. Jam or layback up the polished crack (crux), then follow the crack up and left to a small stance at a 2-bolt anchor with chains. You can belay here (if you want to watch/coach your second through the crux), or continue with the second pitch. P2. 5.6, 90'. Climb up to the chimney left of the bolts, and step left onto the face. Climb up to a finger crack, then traverse right above a little roof (crux). Continue up steep, enjoyable cracks and angle up left on easy ground to a sloping ledge by a steep wall. Belay at a crack with a fixed pin. If this belay is occupied, it's possible to belay about 20' lower at another stance. Variation: near the top of P2, take a right-angling wide crack up and back left, 5.8. Bring a big cam (#4 Camalot) to protect this line. P1 & P2 can be combined with a 50m rope. P3. 5.7, 50'. Climb up into a pod, then work up past a small roof (crux). Continue up the cracks to another sloping ledge. A #1 and #2 Camalot are useful for the belay anchor. P1-3 can be combined with a 70m rope. P4. 5.6, 100'. Traverse left to a short corner with a destroyed fixed pin. Continue traversing left on awkward, off-balance moves past another fixed pin (crux). Go all the way left to a hand crack and climb it to a corner. Don't start up too soon or you'll be off route on a harder variation. Climb the corner, then continue up and right on easy ramps to a belay stance below or just right of a chimney. P5. Several options here: a. Easy finish: 5.4, 60'. Climb the chimney to the top. b. Fun finish: 5.8, 80'. Climb up a ramp right of the chimney to a huge corner with a wide crack. Climb up the face left of the corner to a fixed pin. Continue up the steep headwall and surmount a little roof at the top (crux). If you have a #3 and #4 Camalot, you can belay just above the roof (and watch/coach your second at the crux roof), otherwise continue up an easy gully and belay from a spike of rock at the top. c. Grovel finish: 5.7, 80'. Climb the wide crack in the corner just right of the previous variation. To descend: follow deep grooves to the south until you reach a dirt trail. Go 30' right (west) and then follow the marked Bastille descent trail north and down to the road at the base of the cliff. (Ed. Note: beginner leaders--make sure you're solid on crack techique before trying this one. Placing gear is not trivial for the inexperienced.)","A standard rack to #3 Camalot.

Interesting climbing gets increasingly better with each pitch, as one gains the majestic Southwest Face, finishing on the highest summit in Eldorado Canyon State Park. This is a very fun climb. Due to the loose rocks on the belay ledges, it is NOT advisable to follow another party up Gambit - 120% vigilance is required at the belays, and most of the time you're lost in the views instead, but luckily, you should find Shirt Tail quiet; mostly due to the 45-minute hike. An early start is advisable in the summer as shade is provided all morning until the climber ventures out onto the southwest face. This face can be hot in the afternoon. The following description breaks the climb into 5 pitches. It can be done by condensing P2 & P3, but by breaking them into two sections, the leader avoids some rope drag approaching the 5.8 roof and also enjoys at least one ""normal"" belay (read: slightly uncomfortable Serta-lounger-with-a-view on a carpet of pigeon shit). After all, the other three belays are roomy, comfortable, and relatively safe on good ledges. Pitches 4 and 5 combine nicely with a 60m rope. Approach: follow the newly built (fall 2010) trail up Shirt Tail Peak until it ends at a nice, big, flat rock step. P1. Start just to the right of the base of the Tiger Balm Arete (the blunt arete that narrows and finishes on the West of the summit) from near a large tree growing curiously ""around"" a bulge in the slab, following a large crack that gets thin, passing a small tree and entering a right-facing dihedral. Once at another small tree, jog up and left entering another short, right-facing dihedral. Fun liebacks gain the first big ledge. Belay by a big tree on this ledge. P2. Follow the steep, tricky crack straight up from the ledge, mastering a slight overhang. Interesting climbing continues up steep terrain to a second overhang. Master this small roof, and set up a belay on the pigeon shelf, which actually provides a nice view of your second having fun in the crack below. If you plan to continue on (recommended), mind your rope drag with a long sling when protecting the traverse. P3. From the pigeon shelf, traverse right and stem out across the void with a stunning move into the left-facing dihedral above. A great hand/fist crack follows, splitting the aesthetic dihedral. The crack arcs up and slightly left, ever steepening until it meets an overhang. Jam out the fun roof, and pull onto a roomy ledge with lots of loose rock. [addendum: if you place a #3 in the last ~20 section, there is a good chance that you'll lose it. Place a #2 instead or use a very long sling.] P4. This pitch packs more punch than may be implied by the 5.7 rating it garners. This one is a classic. Improbably, you must first find a way up and right from the roomy belay, through a narrowing slot. A hanging slab with few holds and a half exposed pin forces climbers into the offwidth on the right. Clip the pin, go set up a nice #4 (I used a 3.8"") in the back of the offwidth, reach back, and unclip the (mostly psychological) pin. I won't tell you the secret of the offwidth -- that's half the fun. Surmount the chockstone at the head of the slot, and you'll be standing on a ledge just below the Southwest Face. Now it's party time - step up right and out onto the face, following a right-angling, slightly overhanging hand crack over stupendous exposure with knockout jams...a real treat. Continue up the face until you see a made-to-order 2-foot ledge angling across the face. You get a choice of belays on the ledge, but the crown of the ledge, with two seats, made for airy position and a comfortable crib. You are belaying in space, the flat face dropping away below you. With a 60m rope, you can make it to the top if the drag isn't bad. P5. Continue up the face on good cracks past blocky, seemingly sketchy rock that ends (thankfully!) right on the summit. Stay left near the top to avoid the worst of the loose rock. Bring your second up, watching to the south the busy Eldorado antics, the fascinating Flatirons to the north, or the Indian Peaks to the west; reveling in the solitude of the upper canyon.",SR up to a #4.,"Jul 13, 2020  ·  Lead / Onsight."

Mabe / C. Bernal, March 2004","The dark and ominous Mission Wall is home to many hard 5.11-5.12 routes. This route provides a linkup with Gneiss Roof allowing a fun 4 pitch 5.8, 5.9, 5.9, 5.9+ climb up this intimidating wall. All of the pitches are unique and challenging for the grade and the climbing quality improves from ok to stellar as one ascends the rock. Each pitch has sections that look much harder than they turn out to be. It is relative easy to rap from any of the first three belays. Pitches 1, 2, and 3 can be combined with the generous use of slings and rope drag for a long pitch. One can climb only the two pitches of Ride The Snake with a few QDs, but continuing with Gneiss Roof creates a stellar Clear Creek classic, and it sizes up to other 5.9 classics in Eldo and Boulder Canyon. Ride The Snake starts at the top of a small, left-angling ramp ~20 feet to the left of the start Gneiss Route . P1. 5.8+, 70 feet, 7 bolts. The first 25 feet is on sharp crimpers that lead up to a roof. Angle up and right to a huge jug that allows you to pull around the roof. Continue up a short slab to a two-bolt anchor. P2. 5.9, 70 feet, 6 bolts. The intimating roof above the snake's head is reasonably tamed after the climbing is figured out. The first 30 feet is up steep rock with big and hidden holds. After turning the roof, continue up easy rock to another two-bolt anchor at a nice stance. You can rap here using the P1 anchors by carefully swinging/climbing right. To join Gneiss Roof : Rack: 9 QDs (few mid and shoulder slings), micro to med nuts, Aliens (green, yellow, red), Camalots (#0.75, #1, #2). P3. 5.9, 40 feet, 3 bolts and gear.

Using the roof crack for pro, traverse the rail and place the #1 cam as high as you can reach. Make an airy mantle at the lip of the right side of the roof, stand up and clip a bolt. Continue up slabs, bulges and nice face climbing to Surette Ledge.

This route is best led for the first time following another party unless you don't care about finding the fixed eye-bolts. Since nearly every stance is a rest, it's tough to discern the belays. From the East Bench, move up and to the left across a channel to the first belay. Stay on this side of the channel for the next 5-6 pitches with easy 5.0-5.2 climbing. Pitch 5 will traverse the ""C"" of CU. After pitch 6/7, you must cross the channel at the notch near the top. The last, crux pitch (5.4) starts on the other side of the channel to the top. It's 6 rope-stretching pitches or 8 as described with a 50m rope. DESCENT: there are three rappels from fixed eye-bolts. A single 50m rope is sufficient; on the last rappel, you may either use a double-rope for the 140 feet mostly free-rappel or traverse right on a ledge and rap 72 feet on a single rope to the West Bench. Per Samir Abdosh : after the final rap, hike *north* up the base instead of down. There is a trail that is MUCH easier to descend through than going south.

This is a pleasant, multi-pitch sport climb with several very short crux sections and moderate slab climbing in between.

The FA party rated this 10b, but for someone of my height (6'2"", -1 ape factor), it's 5.9. There are a couple of spots where reach might make a difference. Approach: this route is on the left edge of the Upper East Face of East Blob Rock. See the beta photo for Blob Rock. East Blob is the formation on the right of the photo with the pointed top. The route starts a short ways up the gully that runs up and right along the base of East Blob. Walk up the trail to the base of the gully that separates Blob Rock from East Blob. Walk down and right along the base of Blob Slab and up to the base of the Upper East Face of East Blob.

P2: angle left on easy ground to a short steep wall which is climbed at 5.9 if you can reach the hold. The FA party calls this 10b, and it may be that hard if you are short, 5 bolts. 60'. P3: There are two variations to pitch 3. Since I was self-belaying, I climbed the left variation on the lead and the right variation when I cleaned the pitch. The left variation is better and goes over a bulge at 5.9 to a slab. The right variation climbs a dirty, right-facing corner and is harder ( and was missing the top bolt of the variation (per Áine Huntington ). The start, which looks hard, is easy.

Expect stunning views, solid rock, an unforgettable summit, and fickle weather. From Boston Basin, ascend scree slopes and gullies, aiming for the snowfield and the obvious West Ridge Couloir. Ascend the snowfield to the base of the West Ridge Couloir. In early and mid-season, the best option to gain the ridge itself is to ascend the West Ridge couloir (about 40-45 degree snow). Climb the couloir until it peters out below some steep chimneys. Move left over some 4th class rock into a gully and scramble up to the notch at the start of the West Ridge proper. In late season the snow couloir may be too melted out to climb safely. If this is the case, you can gain the ridge by climbing the rocky gully to the left of the couloir. This is how we did it in September. The rock gully is 4th-easy 5th class but was a little tricky with wet and loose rock and few options for pro. Once the ridge itself is gained, start climbing up (duh?). Stay on or near the ridge for most of the time. The climbing is 4th and easy 5th class. Stay to the left (north side) when in doubt. An obvious steep step is reached about 2/3 of the way up. Ascend this on the left side, passing a fixed piton (5.6). Once past this, follow the ridge crest around the left of the false summit and to the true summit. Descent: There are 2 options for the descent. You can downclimb and rappel the West Ridge itself, or you can do the ""East Ridge descent route"" which is actually on the NE Face. 1. The West Ridge descent seems preferable to me because you're familiar with the route already, the routefinding is minimal, and you can ditch your boots, axe, and crampons at the notch and retrieve them on the way down. Having said that, I haven't done the other descent. From the summit, downclimb and rappel the West Ridge route (1 rope works for the rappels). Once you're back to the notch, you can downclimb or rappel the snow couloir. An alternative to downclimbing the snow couloir is to rappel down the rock rib adjacent to the couloir. The rap route is to the skier's right of the snow couloir. From the notch, downclimb some loose 3rd class rock. Instead of moving to skier's left into the couloir, head right onto more 3rd class rock. Just before the rock drops off steeply, you should locate a rappel station. We did 5 or 6 single rope rappels from here back to the snowfield. You may need to back up some of the rap stations with webbing and rings. 2. The East Ridge Descent Route is another option. I haven't done this one, so I'll tell you what Jim Nelson and Peter Potterfield say in their guide: ""From a horn on the summit make the first of five single-rope rappels (approximately 400 feet total) straight down the NE face to a series of ledges, which are followed East. These ledges are 3rd class, except for short sections of 4th class encountered at several rock rib crossings. Traverse at this level, staying well below the ridge crest, crossing five ribs before climbing up the gully back to the ridge crest at the solitary gendarme (there is a large gendarme that marks the start of the East Ridge climbing route).

This route is so much fun, I know I will be driving back all the way from Utah to do it again soon. Thanks to the hard work of Texas Tower Tim Toula, the climbers of Frisco have their own little ""Big Wall"" that is intelligently protected, with harder variation pitches available for those seeking more challenging climbing, with excellent pitch after pitch of outstanding climbing. MANY OF THE 15-30m PITCHES MAY BE LINKED OR SIMUL-CLIMBED. The stated number of roped pitches is for clarity, ease of route finding, and ease of partner communication. With that said, when linking pitches, verbal and/or visual communication may be seriously impaired or impossible due to the wandering nature of the route as well as incessantly loud noise pollution from busy I-70. The route offers super fun cruising with memorable movement. All belays are bolted. Please leave the rappel links and/or carabiners left at the stations for those who need to rappel the route. Many people new to multi-pitch climbs may choose to only climb the lower wall and these stations have been bootyed and re-equipped already numerous times since initially equipping the route.

Pitch #6: Traverse right (or down & right from the 5.10 var on P #5) on a narrow ledge to a tree and then to the base of a white crystal dike. 4th class, 30m. Pitch #7: Climb the White Crystal Groove either going through Joe's 5.10 mantle variation straight up or start down & right and go to a two bolt belay. 5.7, 30m. Pitch #8: Climb past 3 bolts (1st may be hard to spot) up a rib to a belay at two-bolts. At the belay is a plaque in memory of our mutual friend, Swiss Mountain Guide Res von Känel, who died in the Alps during the same time while Tim was doing the FA. Royal Flush is similar to many long ""Plaisir"" climbs in Switzerland. 5.7, 30m. Pitch #9: Third class (exposed) up and then mostly 2nd class left traversing past 2 small, grungier buttresses. Follow cairns/faint trail, 60+ m. Pitch #10: The White Rib Pitch. Joe's Cracks are nice offerings to the left (5.6) or pass 3 bolts on a slabby pillar (5.7) and belay near a snag. 30m. Pitch #11: Go straight up (5.10) or out right up the Grey Beard Slab past a roof and more slab to a two-bolt belay. 5.6, 30m. Pitch #12: Follow cairns up scree to the base of the apron of the Headwall. 3rd class, ~150m. Look for the bolt line just to the right of a large pine at the base of the Apron. Pitch #13: Climb a classic pitch up a white streak with memorable holds past 1 pin & 5 bolts. 5.7, 30m. Pitch #14: Continue past 3 more bolts & cross the gully at the top of the Apron moving left of the prominent cleft dihedral system of Mount Royal to the ""Headwall"" past 2 bolts to one of 2 two bolt belays. Use the left anchor for the 5.9 version of P15. This anchor is hidden until you walk to the left on a 1 foot ledge system. 5.7, 20m. Pitch #15: Continue straight up (5.10) from right anchor or from the left anchor to a tricky 5.9 system of steep grooves. These merge after 5 bolts. Interesting moves to a two-bolt belay. 5.9, ~18m. Pitch #16: Continue up some in-cut, black-colored plaques passing through a fun Gunks-like roof and belay at Yosemite Ledge with a two bolt belay. 5.8, ~18m. Pitch #17: Climb up to the Grey Shelf past a few bolts. Some small Camalots may be useful here. 5.8, ~18m. Pitch #18: Climb through some blocky roofs with funky rock past a ledge and a two-bolt belay near a tree. A wall register is found here...spray away. 5.8, ~18m. Pitch #19: Follow up a coarse, dirt-filled gully slinging pine trees for protection. Beware of some loose rock. Two bolt belay. Exposed 3rd class, 30m. Pitch #20: Surmount loose blocks to the summit and a sign that asks hikers not to throw rocks due to climbers below. 3rd class, 10m. Though descent via rappel is always an option if inclement weather strikes, from the top, walking off to the south on a great trail which drops down to the town of Frisco is best. Stay south, going down a bit, and then back up a hill for a total of 1/4 mile until turning left and walking downhill. If you're not on a major trail, you probably tried to head downhill too early. 30-45 minutes.","10 QDs and 4-6 shoulder runners and perhaps a small rack of assorted cams if this is pushing your grade (most people won't need extra pro). All belays are bolted and all cruxes are well protected which deems a light rack adequate for protecting this climb.
