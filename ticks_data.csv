Take doubles in the hand-size pieces. Triples to #3 Camalot would make these pitches a lot more reasonable if you’re aiding any lower pitches or 5.9 is difficult for you. Aiding now requires 2 sets offset brassies, single wire DMM nuts, DMM offsets (4x #7 would not go unused) up to #11. 3 hooks, talons are not helpful. Two skyhooks, one cliff hanger. Offset cams are sometimes more useful than Totems on the aid pitches when you need them. 2-3 rivet hangers for summit pitch. #2-4 ballnuts, and 2-3 #2 beaks to be hand placed only. (This is likely controversial, but we firmly believe that a hand placed beak is just as clean as nuts, and possibly further enhances placements where you might actually be able to get a nut in it. Let’s be honest here, nut placements do not make the placement better afterwards. HOW TO NOT BLOW OUT THE ROCK FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS You want a proper nut tool to remove nuts, then use your ATC to tap-tap-tap up on the corner of the nut. It works.

I know the route pretty well, and from memory: P1 - 3 pins ( 2 now ) (one before the traverse above your head, and (now one) at your feet before you pull the roof). P2 - 2 pins ( now one - the one just before the 5.8 dihedral is gone , and one right in the dihedral). P3 - 1 pin ( 2 now , the 1st is old style, with the ring on it in the first open book). There is one more above a semi-rotten ledge. P4 - 2 pins and a bong ( now only 2, one pin in that easy low 5th section, one pin just before the hand traverse. The bong is at the top of the hand traverse is gone ). P5 - I think there's 5 pins? All of them in the 'Pin ladder'. Then you've got two finishes, the bolt ladder has 3, and the Robbin's Traverse has at least one pin before the belay. I can't think of any on pitch 6 (depending on where you belay after the Robbins Travers, there is 1 more pin either high on P5 or low on P6) .
